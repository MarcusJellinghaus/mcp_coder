# Complete SDK Object Testing Coverage

## Problem Summary
The recent test rewrite improved focus by testing utility functions rather than external SDK behavior, but left critical gaps in test coverage for SDK-specific code paths. The current tests only verify dictionary message handling, missing the SDK object detection and tool extraction logic that was the original bug.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Missing Coverage**: `_is_sdk_message()` has no tests for actual SDK objects
- **Incomplete Tool Testing**: No tests for SDK object tool extraction paths
- **Error Handling Gaps**: Exception handling and logging behavior untested
- **Integration Missing**: No end-to-end verification of the complete fix

## Technical Context
The utility functions have two code paths:
1. Dictionary path: `message.get("role")` - well tested
2. SDK object path: `isinstance(message, SystemMessage)` - not tested

Without testing both paths, we cannot verify the fix actually works for the original AttributeError scenario.

## Solution Strategy
1. **Add SDK Object Detection Tests**: Mock SDK classes to test `isinstance()` checks
2. **Complete Tool Extraction Testing**: Test SDK object content processing
3. **Add Error Handling Tests**: Verify graceful degradation with malformed objects
4. **Add Integration Test**: End-to-end test using controlled mocks

## Success Criteria
- ✅ `_is_sdk_message()` tested with both dictionary and SDK object inputs
- ✅ `_get_message_tool_calls()` tested with SDK object content blocks
- ✅ Error handling verified for malformed SDK objects
- ✅ Integration test confirms complete fix without external dependencies
- ✅ All tests use controlled mocks, not real SDK instances

## Implementation Approach
- **Step 1**: Add SDK object detection tests using mocked classes
- **Step 2**: Add SDK object tool extraction tests with mock content blocks
- **Step 3**: Add error handling tests for malformed objects and edge cases
- **Step 4**: Add integration test to verify complete formatting pipeline

This ensures comprehensive test coverage while maintaining the improved focus on testing our own code rather than external SDK behavior.
