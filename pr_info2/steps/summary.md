# Minimal SDK Object Testing Coverage

## Problem Summary
The recent test rewrite improved focus by testing utility functions rather than external SDK behavior, but left a critical gap in test coverage for SDK-specific code paths. The current tests only verify dictionary message handling, missing the SDK object detection logic that was the original bug.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Missing Coverage**: `_is_sdk_message()` has no tests for actual SDK objects
- **Core Issue**: The original AttributeError occurred when SDK objects were accessed with dictionary methods like `.get()`
- **Fix Validation**: No tests verify that the `isinstance()` checks work correctly

## Technical Context
The utility functions have two code paths:
1. Dictionary path: `message.get("role")` - well tested
2. SDK object path: `isinstance(message, SystemMessage)` - not tested

Without testing both paths, we cannot verify the fix actually works for the original AttributeError scenario.

## Minimal Solution Strategy
Instead of comprehensive testing, implement just 2 focused tests:
1. **Mock Test**: Verify `isinstance()` logic works with mocked SDK classes
2. **Integration Test**: Validate with real SDK objects when available

## Success Criteria
- ✅ `_is_sdk_message()` tested with both dictionary and SDK object inputs
- ✅ Basic validation that utility functions handle real SDK objects
- ✅ Integration test skips gracefully when SDK unavailable
- ✅ Implementation takes ~30 minutes total
- ✅ Tests use minimal approach - no over-engineering

## Implementation Approach
- **Step 1**: Add core SDK detection test using mocked classes (15 minutes)
- **Step 2**: Add integration test with real SDK objects if available (15 minutes)

This minimal approach provides 80% of the benefit with 20% of the effort, focusing specifically on the isinstance() logic that prevents the original AttributeError bug while avoiding comprehensive edge case testing.

## Why This Approach Works
- **Sufficient Coverage**: Tests the exact issue that caused the original bug
- **Pragmatic**: Fast implementation without over-engineering  
- **Future-Proof**: Can expand incrementally if more SDK issues arise
- **Real-World Validation**: Integration test catches SDK contract changes
- **Low Maintenance**: Only 2 tests to maintain long-term
