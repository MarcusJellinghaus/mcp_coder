# Step 9: Add Continuation Functionality Tests

## LLM Prompt
```
Based on the summary in PR_Info/steps/summary.md, implement Step 9: Add tests for the --continue-from functionality.

Create tests for the session continuation capability:
- Test loading previous session from stored response file
- Test integrating previous context with new prompt
- Test error handling for missing or invalid response files
- Use the same test patterns established in previous steps

This adds the ability to continue conversations from previously stored sessions.
```

## WHERE
- **File**: `tests/cli/commands/test_prompt.py` (extend existing)
- **Test Addition**: Add to existing test module

## WHAT
- **New Test Function**: `test_continue_from()`
- **Test Logic**: Mock args with continue_from parameter, verify context loading
- **File Loading Mocking**: Mock file reading and JSON parsing operations
- **Context Integration**: Verify previous session context is used in API call

## HOW
- **Mock Setup**: Mock args with `continue_from="path/to/response.json"`
- **File System Mocking**: Mock file reading operations and JSON parsing
- **API Call Verification**: Check that previous context is passed to Claude API
- **Integration Testing**: Verify continuation works with existing verbosity and storage

## ALGORITHM
```
1. Setup mock args with prompt and continue_from file path
2. Mock file system to provide stored session JSON data
3. Mock ask_claude_code_api_detailed_sync to verify context is passed
4. Call execute_prompt function
5. Verify continuation logic:
   - File is read correctly
   - Previous context is loaded
   - New prompt combines with previous context
   - API called with enhanced context
```

## DATA
- **Input**: `argparse.Namespace` with `prompt` and `continue_from="response_file.json"`
- **Mock File Content**: Valid stored session JSON with previous prompt and response
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - File reading operations called
  - Previous context extracted from JSON
  - API call includes both previous context and new prompt
  - Normal output formatting applies
- **API Call Verification**: Ensure enhanced prompt/context passed to Claude API
- **Error Cases**: Test with missing file, invalid JSON structure
