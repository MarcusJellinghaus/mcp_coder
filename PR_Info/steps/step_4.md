# Step 4: Verify Test Functionality and Run Validation

## Context
Reference: `pr_info/steps/summary.md` - Test Structure Reorganization Summary
Prerequisite: Steps 1-3 completed (structure created, files moved, imports updated)

## Objective
Validate that all tests still function correctly after the structural reorganization and that no functionality was broken.

## WHERE
**Test execution locations**:
- `tests/llm_providers/claude/` (all moved test files)
- `tests/` (remaining root-level test files)
- Project root (for pytest execution)

## WHAT
Comprehensive test validation:
```python
# Function signature (conceptual)
def validate_test_structure() -> dict[str, bool]
```

## HOW
- Run pytest to ensure all tests are discoverable
- Check that imports resolve correctly
- Verify no tests were lost or broken during move
- Confirm test execution from new locations

## ALGORITHM
```
1. Run pytest discovery to find all tests
2. Execute moved tests in new location
3. Execute remaining root-level tests
4. Check for any import errors or missing modules
5. Verify test count matches original
6. Report any issues found
```

## DATA
**Input**: Reorganized test structure
**Output**: Test execution results and validation status
**Structure**: Dictionary with test file results and overall success status

## LLM Prompt
```
Validate the test structure reorganization. Based on the summary in pr_info/steps/summary.md and after completing steps 1-3, verify that:

1. All tests can be discovered by pytest
2. All moved tests execute successfully
3. Import statements work correctly
4. No tests were lost during reorganization

Use the pytest checker tools to run tests and validate the structure. Check specifically:
- tests/llm_providers/claude/ tests
- tests/ root level tests (test_llm_interface.py, test_prompt_manager.py, test_input_validation.py)

Report any issues and confirm successful reorganization.
```
