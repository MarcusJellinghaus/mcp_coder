# Step 4: Test Workflow Integration

## Objective
Test the complete workflow integration by running the implement script and verifying it works with existing mcp-coder functionality.

## WHERE
- Test execution from project root
- Verify `pr_info/.conversations/` directory creation
- Check integration with existing modules

## WHAT
### Main Testing Activities
- Manual execution test of `workflows/implement.bat`
- **Prerequisites Testing:** Verify script handles missing dependencies gracefully
- **Integration Testing:** Test with real task tracker and existing tools (using direct API calls)
- **Error Scenarios:** Test with invalid states (no tasks, git issues, etc.)
- **End-to-End Validation:** Complete workflow execution with API integration
- **Documentation:** Create usage examples and troubleshooting guide

## HOW
### Integration Points Testing
```python
# Test areas
- Task tracker: get_incomplete_tasks() returns expected data
- Prompt manager: get_prompt() retrieves template successfully  
- LLM interface: ask_llm() completes without errors
- Formatters: format_code() processes files correctly
- Git operations: commit command executes successfully
```

## ALGORITHM
```
1. Test prerequisite validation
2. Create test task in pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md if needed
3. Test with various task tracker states
4. Run workflows/implement.bat from project root
5. Verify error handling and user feedback
6. Validate conversation storage and formatting
7. Test commit functionality
8. Document findings and create troubleshooting guide
```

## DATA
### Test Validation Points
- **Task Detection**: Script identifies incomplete tasks correctly
- **Prompt Access**: Successfully retrieves implementation prompt template
- **LLM Response**: Receives and processes LLM response
- **File Creation**: `pr_info/.conversations/step_N.md` created with content
- **Formatting**: Code files processed by black/isort
- **Commit**: Git commit created with auto-generated message

### Expected Outputs
- Console output with timestamps for each step
- New conversation file with LLM interaction
- Formatted source code
- New git commit
- **Additional Deliverables:**
  - `workflows/README.md` enhanced with usage examples
  - `workflows/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with common issues and solutions

## Implementation Notes
- This is manual testing - not unit tests (keeping it simple)
- **Comprehensive testing scope:** Prerequisites, integration, error scenarios
- Focus on end-to-end workflow functionality with enhanced validation
- Verify error messages are helpful and guide user to resolution
- Test with actual pr_info structure if available
- Create troubleshooting documentation for common issues

## LLM Prompt
```
Please look at pr_info/steps/summary.md and implement Step 4.

Test the workflow integration:
1. Ensure there's at least one incomplete task in pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md for testing
2. Run the implement workflow manually 
3. Verify each step executes correctly with proper output
4. Check that conversation files are created
5. Validate that formatting and commit operations work
6. Fix any integration issues found

This is manual testing - just verify the workflow works end-to-end with existing mcp-coder functionality.
Focus only on Step 4 testing and fixes.
