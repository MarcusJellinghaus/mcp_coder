# Step 5: Final Documentation and Cleanup

## Context
Reference: `pr_info/steps/summary.md` - Test Structure Reorganization Summary
Prerequisite: Steps 1-4 completed (full reorganization and validation successful)

## Objective
Document the new test structure and ensure the reorganization is complete and ready for development use.

## WHERE
**Documentation updates**:
- `README.md` (if test structure is documented)
- `pr_info/steps/completion_report.md` (new file)
- Project root (final structure verification)

## WHAT
Create completion documentation and final verification:
```python
# Function signature (conceptual)
def create_completion_report() -> str
```

## HOW
- Document the new test structure layout
- Create a completion report with before/after comparison
- Verify final directory structure matches target
- Ensure all goals from summary were achieved

## ALGORITHM
```
1. List current test directory structure
2. Compare with target structure from summary
3. Document benefits achieved
4. Create migration guide for developers
5. Generate completion report
6. Perform final validation check
```

## DATA
**Input**: Completed reorganized test structure
**Output**: Completion report and structure documentation
**Structure**: Markdown documentation with before/after comparison and benefits

## LLM Prompt
```
Create final documentation for the test structure reorganization. Based on the summary in pr_info/steps/summary.md and after completing steps 1-4, create:

1. A completion report at pr_info/steps/completion_report.md showing:
   - Before/after directory structure comparison
   - Benefits achieved
   - Any issues encountered and resolved
   - Final validation results

2. List the final test directory structure to confirm it matches the target

3. Verify that all objectives from the summary were achieved:
   - Tests mirror source structure
   - All tests functional
   - Improved discoverability and maintainability
   - No test content changes

Document the successful completion of this reorganization task.
```
