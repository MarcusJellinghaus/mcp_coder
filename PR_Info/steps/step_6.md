# Step 6: Documentation and Future Roadmap

## Objective
Document the completed refactoring work and create a comprehensive roadmap for advanced features that could be implemented using the Claude Code Python SDK.

## WHERE
- `pr_info/claude_code_sdk_features.md` (new) - Advanced features documentation
- `README.md` (modify) - Update usage examples and API documentation
- `src/mcp_coder/__init__.py` (modify) - Add docstrings for new exports
- `CHANGELOG.md` (new) - Document the refactoring changes

## WHAT
### Documentation Updates:
```python
# Updated docstrings for new functions
def ask_llm(question: str, provider: str = "claude", method: str = "cli", timeout: int = 30) -> str:
    """Ask a question to an LLM with configurable provider and method."""

def ask_claude_code(question: str, method: str = "cli", timeout: int = 30) -> str:
    """Ask Claude Code a question using CLI or Python SDK."""
```

### Future Features Document:
- Chat history management capabilities
- MCP server integration options
- Custom tool development guide
- Streaming response implementation
- Advanced configuration options

## HOW
### Integration Points:
- Update existing docstrings to reflect new architecture
- Document migration path for users
- Provide examples for both CLI and API methods
- Create feature comparison table

### Documentation Structure:
```markdown
## claude_code_sdk_features.md
- Overview of advanced SDK capabilities
- Chat history and conversation management  
- MCP server integration for external tools
- Custom tool development with Python functions
- Streaming responses and real-time interaction
- Implementation roadmap and priorities
```

## ALGORITHM
```pseudocode
1. Document new API surface area and usage examples
2. Create comprehensive feature comparison (CLI vs API)
3. Research and document advanced SDK capabilities  
4. Prioritize future features by complexity and value
5. Create implementation timeline for advanced features
6. Update existing documentation for new architecture
```

## DATA
### Documentation Deliverables:
- **README.md**: Updated usage examples, API reference
- **claude_code_sdk_features.md**: Advanced features roadmap
- **CHANGELOG.md**: What changed in this refactoring
- **Docstrings**: Complete API documentation in code

### Advanced Features to Document:
- Conversation continuation and session management
- MCP server configuration and custom integrations  
- Real-time streaming responses
- Custom Python tools and hooks
- Advanced prompting and system configuration
- Performance optimization options

## Testing Strategy
- Verify all documentation examples work correctly
- Test code snippets in documentation
- Ensure examples run successfully with current implementation
- Validate that future feature descriptions are technically accurate

## LLM Prompt for Implementation
```
I need to implement Step 6 of the LLM interface refactoring plan. Please:

1. Read the summary from pr_info/steps/summary.md to understand what we accomplished
2. Update README.md with new usage examples showing both ask_claude() and ask_llm() functions
3. Create pr_info/claude_code_sdk_features.md documenting advanced SDK capabilities we discovered during research
4. Add comprehensive docstrings to all new functions in the codebase
5. Create a CHANGELOG.md documenting the refactoring changes
6. Focus the features document on concrete capabilities with implementation difficulty estimates

This completes the refactoring project and sets up the roadmap for future enhancements.
```
