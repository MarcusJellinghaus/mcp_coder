# Step 6: Update Batch Script

**STATUS**: **ALREADY COMPLETE** ✅ - No action needed.

**Verification**: The `workflows/implement.bat` file already contains the required `--project-dir .` parameter.

**Current batch script content**:
```batch
@echo off
REM Simple implement workflow - orchestrates existing mcp-coder functionality
REM Created in Step 3: Create Simple Implement Workflow Script

echo Starting implement workflow...
python workflows/implement.py --project-dir .

if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Workflow failed with exit code %ERRORLEVEL%
    pause
    exit /b %ERRORLEVEL%
)

echo Workflow completed successfully!
```

**Analysis**: The script is properly configured with:
- ✅ `--project-dir .` parameter included
- ✅ Error handling maintained  
- ✅ User experience preserved
- ✅ Current directory as default project path

**Result**: This step requires no implementation work.

## ~~Original Objective~~ **NOT NEEDED**
~~Update the `implement.bat` batch script to use the new `--project-dir` parameter with current directory as default.~~

The objective was already fulfilled in a previous implementation.
