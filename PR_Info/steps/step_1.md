# Step 1: Create Basic Workflow Infrastructure

## Objective
Set up the foundational structure for the workflow system with documentation and the basic pattern.

## WHERE
- Create `workflows/` directory at project root
- Create `workflows/README.md` 
- Create `workflows/implement.bat`

## WHAT
### Main Functions
- No functions needed - just file/folder creation
- Document the workflow concept and reference standard tools

## HOW
### Integration Points  
- Reference existing mcp-coder tools in documentation:
  - `prompt_manager.get_prompt()` for retrieving prompts
  - Standard tools for formatting, committing, task tracking

## ALGORITHM
```
1. Create workflows directory
2. Write README with concept explanation
3. List standard tools (prompts, formatters, commit, task_tracker)
4. Create placeholder batch file
5. Document the pattern for future workflows
```

## DATA
### Files Created
- `workflows/README.md` - String content with documentation
- `workflows/implement.bat` - Single line batch command
- Directory structure established for workflow pattern

## Implementation Notes
- Keep README simple and focused
- Reference existing functionality rather than reinventing
- Establish clear pattern for future workflow additions
- No code complexity - just documentation and structure

## LLM Prompt
```
Please look at pr_info/steps/summary.md and implement Step 1.

Create the basic workflow infrastructure:
1. Create workflows/ directory
2. Create workflows/README.md with concept explanation and tool references  
3. Create workflows/implement.bat placeholder batch file
4. Keep it simple following KISS principles

Document the workflow concept and reference standard mcp-coder tools like get_prompt(), formatters, commit operations, and task tracking.

Focus only on Step 1 - don't implement the actual workflow script yet.
