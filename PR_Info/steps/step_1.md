# Step 1: REMOVED - No Testing Required

## Decision
**This step has been removed** - No testing will be implemented for workflows based on project review decisions.

During plan review, it was decided to focus purely on implementation without workflow testing to reduce complexity and implementation time.

## Next Step
Proceed directly to **Step 2: Add Project Directory Parameter to Argument Parser**
