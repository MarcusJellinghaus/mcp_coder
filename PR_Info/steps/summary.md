# Get Git Diff Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implement a `get_git_diff_for_commit()` function in `git_operations.py` that generates comprehensive git diff output for LLM analysis, replacing the functionality of `tools/commit_summary.bat`.

## Core Functionality
- Generate git diff showing staged, unstaged, and untracked files
- Use read-only git operations (no state modification)
- Return formatted string suitable for commit message generation
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Technical Approach
- **Read-only operations**: Use `git diff`, `git diff --cached`, and `git diff --no-index` 
- **No git state changes**: Unlike batch file, never modify repository state
- **Standard git output**: Unified diff format with `--no-prefix` and `--unified=5`
- **Error handling**: Return None on errors, log appropriately

## Implementation Steps
1. **Write failing tests** for core functionality 
2. **Implement basic function** with signature and validation
3. **Add diff generation logic** for all file states
4. **Add error handling** and edge cases
5. **Integration testing** with existing git operations

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass including existing git_operations tests
- Function generates same diff output as batch file
- No git repository state is modified during execution
- Proper error handling for invalid repositories

## Files Modified
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py` - Add new function
- `tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py` - Add focused tests
