# Project Decisions Log

## Decisions Made During Plan Review Discussion

### 1. Testing Approach
**Decision**: No testing at all for workflows  
**Discussion**: When asked about test coverage options (A: Essential, B: Moderate, C: Comprehensive), user chose "No testing at all for workflows"  
**Impact**: Removes Step 1 (unit tests) and integration tests from Step 6 entirely

### 2. Implementation Step Structure  
**Decision**: Keep separate steps (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about step consolidation options (A: Keep Separate, B: Combine 3-5, C: Combine All), user chose "A"  
**Impact**: Maintain current 4-step breakdown (Steps 2-5) for clear progress tracking

### 3. Error Handling Approach
**Decision**: Fail-fast error handling (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about error handling options (A: Fail-Fast, B: Graceful Degradation, C: Interactive Recovery), user chose "A"  
**Impact**: Simple validation, clear error messages, exit on invalid directory

### 4. Path Resolution Strategy
**Decision**: Always convert to absolute paths at the beginning, once only (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about path resolution options (A: Always Absolute, B: Preserve Original, C: Hybrid), user chose "A" with clarification "right at the beginning, once only at the beginning, please. Also, log.info the project_dir"  
**Impact**: Convert relative to absolute paths immediately in main(), log the resolved path

### 5. Function Parameter Order
**Decision**: project_dir as first parameter (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about parameter placement for `save_conversation(content: str, step_num: int)` (A: First, B: Last), user chose "A"  
**Impact**: All functions will have `project_dir: Path` as first parameter for consistency

### 6. Constants and Path Operations
**Decision**: Keep string constants, build paths as needed (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about constants handling (A: Keep String Constants, B: Convert to Path Constants, C: Inline Path Building), user chose "A"  
**Impact**: Maintain current constants, build paths like `project_dir / PR_INFO_DIR / ".conversations"`

### 7. Project Directory Logging
**Decision**: Log once in main() after resolution (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about logging placement (A: Once in main(), B: In resolve_project_dir(), C: Multiple places), user chose "A"  
**Impact**: Single log statement in main() after path resolution

### 8. Final Implementation Order
**Decision**: Approve the revised order (A)  
**Discussion**: When asked about implementation sequence confirmation (A: Approve Order, B: Modify Order, C: Combine Steps), user chose "A"  
**Impact**: Proceed with Steps 2-6 as planned, no further changes needed
