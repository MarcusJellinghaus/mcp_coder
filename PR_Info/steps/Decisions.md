# Project Decisions Log

## Decisions Made During Plan Review Discussion

### 1. Step 5 Scope - Comprehensive Edge Case Testing
**Decision**: Keep comprehensive edge case testing (Option A)
**Discussion**: When asked about Step 5 scope (A: Keep comprehensive, B: Simplify, C: Skip), user chose "A"
**Impact**: Step 5 includes integration, special characters, performance, consistency, and empty repo tests

### 2. Function Documentation Enhancement  
**Decision**: Keep current simple docstrings (Option B)
**Discussion**: When asked about adding usage examples (A: Add examples, B: Keep simple, C: Examples for main only), user chose "B"
**Impact**: No changes to existing docstring format - they remain clear and concise

### 3. Success Case Logging
**Decision**: No success logging (Option C)  
**Discussion**: When asked about adding success logging (A: All functions, B: Main function only, C: No success logging), user chose "C"
**Impact**: Keep current error-only logging approach, follows existing patterns

### 4. Performance Testing Approach
**Decision**: No performance testing
**Discussion**: When asked about performance thresholds (A: Strict <0.1s, B: Reasonable <1.0s, C: Lenient <5.0s), user responded "No performance testing"
**Impact**: Remove performance testing entirely from Step 5

### 5. Step 5 Final Scope After Performance Removal
**Decision**: Skip Step 5 entirely (Option C)
**Discussion**: When asked about remaining Step 5 content after performance removal (A: Keep all remaining, B: Keep integration/special chars only, C: Skip entirely), user chose "C"  
**Impact**: Step 5 completely removed - basic tests from Step 1 are sufficient

### 6. Final Implementation Order
**Decision**: Proceed with simplified 4-step plan (Option A)
**Discussion**: When asked about final step sequence (A: 4-step plan, B: Add validation step, C: Combine steps), user chose "A"
**Impact**: Implementation reduced to Steps 1-4 only, with Step 6 already complete (batch script ready)
