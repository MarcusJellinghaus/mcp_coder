# Project Plan Decisions

## Decisions Made During Review Discussion

### 1. Plan Approval Status
**Decision:** Project plan approved for implementation as-is with no substantial changes required  
**Discussion Context:** Human asked for plan review, I provided comprehensive analysis showing plan is well-structured and follows excellent software engineering practices  
**Rationale:** Plan demonstrates proper KISS principle, TDD approach, and appropriate scope management

### 2. Optional Enhancement - Test Coverage
**Decision:** Consider adding "nothing to push" test case (when remote is up-to-date)  
**Discussion Context:** I suggested this as optional enhancement during review, noting it would improve test completeness  
**Status:** Optional - not required for implementation

### 3. Complexity Assessment
**Decision:** No complexity reduction needed - plan is already optimally simplified  
**Discussion Context:** Human specifically asked if complexity could be reduced, I determined current approach is appropriate  
**Rationale:** 3-step approach (Test → Implementation → Documentation) is ideal granularity, further reduction would make it less useful

### 4. Implementation Readiness  
**Decision:** Plan is ready for immediate implementation following existing structure  
**Discussion Context:** After thorough review, confirmed all steps are well-defined and follow existing codebase patterns  
**Next Action:** Proceed with Step 1 implementation when ready

## Non-Decisions (No Changes Made)

- Return value structure (already consistent with existing functions)
- Error handling scope (focusing on 'origin' remote is appropriate)
- Documentation approach (minimal changes following existing patterns are correct)
- Function signature and implementation approach (well-designed as specified)
