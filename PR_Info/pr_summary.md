# MCP Coder Project Foundation

## Summary

This pull request establishes the foundational structure for MCP Coder, an AI-powered software development automation toolkit that integrates Claude Code CLI with MCP servers for intelligent code analysis and implementation workflows.

## Key Changes

### Core Infrastructure
- **Package Structure**: Created complete Python package with `src/mcp_coder/` module structure
- **Build Configuration**: Added `pyproject.toml` with project metadata, dependencies, and development tools configuration
- **README Documentation**: Comprehensive project overview with architecture diagram and quick start guide

### Core Modules

#### Claude Client (`claude_client.py`)
- Programmatic interface to Claude Code CLI with automatic executable detection
- Cross-platform support for Windows and Unix systems
- Robust error handling for timeouts, command failures, and missing installations
- `ask_claude()` function for direct LLM interaction with customizable timeouts

#### Subprocess Runner (`subprocess_runner.py`)
- Advanced subprocess execution with MCP STDIO isolation support
- Automatic Python command detection and environment isolation
- Comprehensive timeout handling and process cleanup
- Support for both regular and file-based STDIO isolation modes
- Detailed error reporting and execution metrics

### Quality Assurance & CI/CD

#### Testing Framework
- Comprehensive unit tests for Claude client functionality
- Integration tests for real Claude CLI interaction (marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`)
- Mock-based testing for isolated unit testing
- Test coverage for error conditions and edge cases

#### Code Quality Tools
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Automated testing with Python 3.11, formatting checks (black, isort), linting (pylint), and type checking (mypy)
- **Dependabot**: Weekly dependency updates with automated PR generation
- **Local Development Scripts**: Batch files for running quality checks, formatting, and generating commit summaries

#### Development Automation Tools
- `checks2clipboard.bat`: Comprehensive quality checking with sequential pylint → pytest → mypy execution
- `commit_summary.bat`: Automated git diff generation for LLM-assisted commit message creation
- `pr_review.bat` / `pr_summary.bat`: Pull request analysis and documentation automation

### Development Process Documentation

#### Structured Workflow (`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md`)
- **Feature Planning**: LLM-driven analysis and step-by-step breakdown methodology
- **Implementation Steps**: Code + validation + commit preparation workflow
- **Feature Completion**: PR review and summary generation process
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory pylint, pytest, and mypy validation before proceeding

#### Task Management (`TASK_TRACKER.md`)
- GitHub-style checkbox tracking for implementation steps
- Integration with development process for milestone tracking
- Template structure for consistent task management

### Configuration & Setup

#### Claude Code Integration (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- Integration instructions for Claude Code CLI
- Mandatory quality check requirements for all code changes
- MCP server integration guidelines

#### Git Configuration
- `.gitignore` optimized for Python development with MCP-specific exclusions
- Git hooks preparation for automated quality checking

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Design
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation between Claude client, subprocess utilities, and development tools
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows and Unix compatibility with platform-specific optimizations
- **MCP Integration Ready**: Foundation for future MCP server integration (mcp-code-checker, mcp-server-filesystem)

### Error Handling & Reliability
- Comprehensive subprocess timeout and cleanup mechanisms
- Graceful degradation when Claude CLI is not available
- Detailed error reporting with actionable error messages

### Development Experience
- **Automated Quality Checks**: One-command execution of all quality tools
- **LLM-Assisted Workflows**: Integration points for AI-driven development assistance
- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Clear process documentation for consistent implementation

## Dependencies
- **Core**: No runtime dependencies (lightweight design)
- **Development**: Integration with `mcp-code-checker` and `mcp-server-filesystem` via git dependencies
- **Tools**: Standard Python development stack (pytest, pylint, mypy, black, isort)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Isolated testing with comprehensive mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Real Claude CLI interaction (optional, marked separately)
- **Quality Gates**: All changes require passing pylint, pytest, and mypy checks

## Future Roadiness
This foundation enables:
- **Automated Testing Workflows**: Integration with pytest, pylint, mypy via MCP servers
- **Git Operations**: Automated commit workflows with AI-generated messages
- **Feature Planning**: AI-driven analysis from GitHub issues
- **Implementation Automation**: TDD workflows with test-first development
- **Pull Request Management**: Automated branch creation, summaries, and reviews

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes (new project)
- Claude Code CLI installation required for full functionality
- Development dependencies installed via `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
