# Implementation Task: Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the task tracker to understand what needs to be done and then implement it step by step.I can see that I need to work on "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation". Looking at the task tracker, the implementation and quality checks for Step 1 are already complete, so I need to prepare a git commit for the test implementation.

Let me use the TodoWrite tool to track this task:Now let me check the current git status to see what changes need to be committed:The working tree is clean, which means there are no changes to commit. Let me check if the tests mentioned in Step 1 actually exist:I can see that the tests are already implemented in `tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py`. The `TestGitBranchOperations` class contains comprehensive tests for the three branch name functions that are mentioned in Step 1. Looking at the task tracker, it appears that Step 1 (implementation and quality checks) are already marked as complete, but there are no changes to commit since the git status shows a clean working tree.

Let me check the current implementation to see what functions exist:I can see that the `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py` file exists but doesn't contain the three branch name functions that were supposed to be implemented in Step 1. Looking at the task tracker again, I see that Step 1 tests were implemented but the actual functions are missing. Let me check what functions are currently imported in the test file:I can see that the test file imports `get_current_branch_name`, `get_main_branch_name`, and `get_parent_branch_name`, but these functions don't exist in the actual implementation file. The issue is that Step 1 was marked as complete in the task tracker, but the functions weren't actually implemented yet.

Based on the task tracker, I need to work on "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation". Since the tests are written but the functions don't exist, I need to run tests to see the current state before committing.

Let me update my todo and run the tests to see what's needed:Let me check what's available in the tests directory:I can see the test file exists. Let me run pytest to see what's actually happening:Let me check if there's an issue with imports by running a basic test:Now I understand the issue. The tests are trying to import functions that don't exist yet (`get_current_branch_name`, `get_main_branch_name`, `get_parent_branch_name`). The test file was written but the actual functions haven't been implemented yet.

Looking at the task tracker again, I realize the situation:
- Step 1 **Implementation**: Tests were written but functions aren't implemented 
- Step 1 **Quality Checks**: Can't pass because functions don't exist
- Step 1 **Commit**: Need to commit the failing tests first

This means I should commit the current state with the test implementation (even though tests fail because functions don't exist), as that's what "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation" means.

Let me update my todo and prepare the commit:The working tree is clean, which means the tests have already been committed. Let me check the git log to see recent commits:Perfect! I can see that commit `4be00e1 test: add comprehensive tests for branch name functions` was already made. This means "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation" has already been completed.

Let me check the task tracker to see the current status and update it accordingly:I can see that "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation" is still marked as incomplete [ ], but the git log shows it was actually completed in commit `4be00e1`. I need to mark this task as complete.Perfect! I have successfully completed the task "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation". 

## Summary

The task "Step 1 Commit: Prepare git commit for test implementation" has been completed. The commit was already made as `4be00e1 test: add comprehensive tests for branch name functions` which added comprehensive tests for the three branch name functions (`get_current_branch_name`, `get_main_branch_name`, and `get_parent_branch_name`) to `tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py`.

I have updated the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark this step as complete [x]. 

**Commit message for the Step 1 task**: `test: add comprehensive tests for branch name functions`

The next step would be "Step 2: Implement get_current_branch_name Function" but per the instructions, I should only work on one task and not pick further tasks automatically.
