# Implementation Task: Step 2: Implement Git Push Function

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 2: Implement Git Push Function

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the next task from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Let me first check the current task details and then implement it step by step.Now let me check the specific step details:Let me also check the summary and current git_operations.py to understand the context:I'll implement Step 2: the `git_push()` function. Let me start by tracking this task and then implement the function.Now let me check the test file to understand what the function needs to do:Now I'll implement the `git_push()` function. Based on the test, I can see it should follow the same pattern as other functions in `git_operations.py`:Now let me mark the implementation task as completed and update to the testing phase:Now let me run the code quality checks as required by the project instructions:I need to fix the type annotation. The issue is with `dict[str, any]` - it should be `dict[str, Any]` with capital A and I need to import `Any` from `typing`:Now let me run the code quality checks again:Perfect! Let me update the todo list and run the specific tests to verify the implementation:Now let me run the specific tests for git workflows to verify my implementation works:Great! The git integration tests are passing. Let me also check if there are any tests that specifically mention `git_push` to ensure they pass:I can see there are tests that expect the git_push function. Let me run those specific tests to verify my implementation works:Perfect! The git_push tests are passing. Let me update the todo list and mark the task as completed:Now let me check the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 2 as complete:## Summary

**Step 2: Implement Git Push Function** has been completed successfully! 

### What was implemented:
- Added `git_push(project_dir: Path) -> dict[str, Any]` function to `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py`
- Follows the same error handling pattern as `commit_staged_files()` and other existing functions
- Uses GitPython's `repo.git.push("origin", current_branch)` to push to origin remote
- Returns structured result: `{"success": bool, "error": str | None}`
- Added proper type hints with `PushResult` TypedDict
- Handles all error cases: invalid repository, Git command errors, network issues, etc.

### Verification completed:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: All tests pass (428 tests total, 45 git integration tests)
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
- ✅ **Specific git_push tests**: Both test cases pass

### Commit message:
```
feat: implement git_push function for pushing to origin remote

- Add git_push() function to git_operations.py
- Follow existing patterns for error handling and return structure  
- Handle Git command errors, network issues, no remote repository
- Include proper type hints with PushResult TypedDict
- All quality checks pass: pylint, pytest, mypy
```

The implementation is ready and all requirements from Step 2 have been fulfilled. The function seamlessly integrates with the existing git operations module and passes all tests.
