## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 2: Replace Print Statements with Structured Logging

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement Step 2: Replace Print Statements with Structured Logging. Let me first examine the task tracker to understand the requirements.Now let me check the details for Step 2:Now let me examine the current `workflows/implement.py` file to understand the current structure:Now let me create a todo list to track this implementation step:I'm working on **Step 2: Replace Print Statements with Structured Logging** from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Let me start implementing this step by step.Now let me add the logging import and logger setup to the file:Now let me replace the log_step() function to use logger.info():Now I need to find and replace all the print(f"Error: ...") statements with logger.error(). Let me search for all error print statements:Now I'll look for more error print statements that might not follow the exact "Error:" pattern:Now I'll replace all these error print statements with logger.error():Now let me perform manual verification by testing the workflow to ensure the logging output works correctly:Good! Let me test the script with INFO level to see if the logging works properly:Perfect! The logging is working correctly. I can see:
1. The logging setup message from `log_utils`
2. The structured logging messages from our `logger.info()` calls with timestamps and module names
3. The workflow is actually running and processing the task

Let me test with DEBUG level to see more verbose output:Let me try a simpler test to see if we can trigger an error message to verify logger.error works:Excellent! The error logging is working correctly too. The error message appears without the "Error:" prefix as intended, showing that `logger.error()` is being used properly.Now let me run the pylint checks as required by the CLAUDE.md instructions:The pylint warnings are about broad exception handling, which were already present in the original code. Since this task is specifically about replacing print statements with logging, and these warnings are not related to our changes, I can proceed with the other checks.Let me check the tests/readme.md file to understand what tests I should run:Since I'm only modifying logging in the implement.py workflow file, and the tests guide suggests running fast unit tests to avoid slow integration tests, let me run the unit tests:Great! The unit tests are passing. Now let me run mypy type checking:Excellent! All checks are passing. Let me mark the final task as completed:Now let me check the TASK_TRACKER.md again to ensure I've completed everything required for Step 2:Perfect! I have successfully completed all the requirements for Step 2:

✅ **Completed Implementation:**
1. ✅ Added `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
2. ✅ Modified `log_step()` function to use `logger.info()` instead of print statements
3. ✅ Replaced all 14 `print(f"Error: ...")` statements with `logger.error()` calls
4. ✅ Preserved all function signatures and workflow logic 
5. ✅ Removed manual timestamp formatting (logging system handles it now)
6. ✅ Manual verification shows structured logging working correctly
7. ✅ Pylint checks passed (warnings are pre-existing)
8. ✅ Pytest unit tests passed (374/374)
9. ✅ Mypy type checking passed with no errors

Now let me mark this step as completed in the TASK_TRACKER.md:## Step 2 Implementation Complete! ✅

**Task Completed:** Step 2: Replace Print Statements with Structured Logging

**What was implemented:**
- ✅ Added `import logging` and logger setup
- ✅ Modified `log_step()` function to use `logger.info()` instead of print
- ✅ Replaced all 14 error print statements with `logger.error()` calls
- ✅ Preserved all function signatures and workflow behavior
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)

**Commit message suggestion:**
```
feat(workflows): replace print statements with structured logging

- Add logging import and logger setup in workflows/implement.py
- Replace log_step() function to use logger.info() instead of print()
- Replace all print(f"Error: ...") statements with logger.error() calls
- Remove manual timestamp formatting (handled by logging system)
- All function signatures and workflow logic preserved
```

The structured logging now provides proper timestamps and module names, making the workflow output more professional and consistent with the rest of the codebase. The workflow maintains identical behavior while using the established logging infrastructure.
