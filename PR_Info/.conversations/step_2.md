# Implementation Task: Step 2 Implementation: Add `get_current_branch_name()` function to `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 2 Implementation: Add `get_current_branch_name()` function to `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll implement the next task from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Let me first read the task tracker to understand what needs to be done.I can see that Step 2 is the current task to work on. Let me read the current git_operations.py file to understand the existing code structure and patterns.Now let me also check the existing tests to understand the expected behavior of the `get_current_branch_name()` function:Now let me also check the tests/readme.md to understand which tests I should run:I'll implement the `get_current_branch_name()` function as specified in Step 2. Let me create a todo list to track this task.Now I'll implement the `get_current_branch_name()` function in `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py`. Based on the existing patterns and tests, I need to:

1. Use existing `is_git_repository()` validation
2. Handle detached HEAD state gracefully (return None)
3. Follow existing error handling patterns 
4. Use `repo.active_branch.name` for branch detectionNow I need to update the imports to make sure `get_current_branch_name` is available. Let me check the test file to see if it's already imported:Let me see the full import section:Good, the imports are already there. Now let me mark the first todo as completed and move to the quality checks:Now let me run the quality checks. I'll run the branch-specific tests first since that's what I implemented, then the full checks:Let me run the tests with a different approach. Let me check if the test class exists:Let me try running all git integration tests to see what's available:Good! The tests are running. Let me run a more specific test to check my implementation:Let me run the full quality checks as required by the project instructions:Perfect! All quality checks passed. Let me update my todos and mark the step as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md:Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 2 as completed:## Step 2 Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the `get_current_branch_name()` function with the following features:

### Implementation Details:
- **Function signature**: `get_current_branch_name(project_dir: Path) -> Optional[str]`
- **Validation**: Uses existing `is_git_repository()` for input validation
- **Error handling**: Follows established patterns with proper logging at debug/warning levels
- **Detached HEAD**: Gracefully handles detached HEAD state by catching `TypeError` and returning `None`
- **Branch detection**: Uses `repo.active_branch.name` as specified in requirements
- **Context management**: Uses existing `_safe_repo_context()` for proper resource cleanup

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 396 tests passed  
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Commit Message:
**Step 2: Add get_current_branch_name() function**

The implementation is complete and ready. All tests pass and the function follows the existing code patterns and requirements specified in the task tracker.
