## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 2: Add Project Directory Parameter to Argument Parser

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll examine the task tracker and implement Step 2. Let me start by reading the task details.Let me read the specific details for Step 2:Now I'll set up the todo for this task and examine the current implementation:Now I need to examine the current imports and understand what needs to be added. I can see that `Optional` and `Path` are already imported, so I can proceed with implementation:Now I'll implement the changes according to the specification:Now I'll add the new `resolve_project_dir()` function. I'll add it after the `parse_arguments()` function:Now I'll update the `main()` function to use the resolved project directory:I need to remove the hardcoded `project_dir = Path.cwd()` line since we now have it resolved from the argument parser:Now I'll run the code quality checks to ensure the implementation is correct:Now let me check what tests exist to run the appropriate pytest checks:I'll run just the unit tests since they don't require git operations or Claude integration:Perfect! All code quality checks pass. Now I need to mark Step 2 as complete in the task tracker:## Step 2 Complete ✅

I have successfully implemented **Step 2: Add Project Directory Parameter to Argument Parser**. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Summary:
1. **Enhanced `parse_arguments()`** - Added `--project-dir` argument with proper help text and metavar
2. **Created `resolve_project_dir()`** - New function that:
   - Converts relative paths to absolute paths using `Path.resolve()`
   - Validates directory exists and is accessible
   - Ensures it's a git repository (contains `.git`)
   - Provides clear error messages and graceful exit on validation failures
3. **Updated `main()`** - Now uses resolved project directory and logs the resolved path

### Key Features:
- **Optional parameter**: `--project-dir` defaults to current directory if not specified
- **Path validation**: Comprehensive validation with clear error messages
- **Absolute path conversion**: All relative paths converted to absolute immediately
- **Git repository validation**: Ensures the directory is a git repository
- **Error handling**: Graceful exit with `sys.exit(1)` on validation errors

### Quality Assurance:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors  
- ✅ **Pytest**: 377/433 unit tests pass (excluded integration tests as instructed)

### Commit Message:
```
feat: add --project-dir argument parsing and path resolution

- Add --project-dir optional argument to parse_arguments()
- Create resolve_project_dir() function for path validation
- Update main() to use resolved project directory with logging
- Validate directory exists, is accessible, and contains .git
- Convert relative paths to absolute paths immediately
```

The implementation focuses purely on argument parsing and path resolution as specified, without modifying other functions yet. Step 2 is now complete and ready for the next implementation step.
