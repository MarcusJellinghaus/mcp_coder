# Implementation Task: Step 1: Implement Git Push Test (TDD)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 1: Implement Git Push Test (TDD)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the TASK_TRACKER.md file to understand the current task and implement it step by step.Now let me check the specific details for Step 1:Let me also check the summary to understand the context better:Now let me check the existing test structure to understand the patterns:I'll now implement Step 1: Implement Git Push Test (TDD) by creating comprehensive tests for the git push workflow. Let me start by using the TodoWrite tool to track this task.Now let me examine the existing test structure and imports to understand the patterns I need to follow:Now I need to check the existing git_operations.py file to see what functions I need to import and understand the expected return structure. Let me also check if there are any test files related to checking which test markers to run:Now let me check the existing git_operations.py to understand the import structure:Now I'll implement the git push tests following TDD principles. Based on the step 1 specification, I need to add two test functions to the TestGitWorkflows class. Let me add the git push tests:Now let me run the tests to verify they work correctly. Based on the test markers I saw, I should run git_integration tests:I need to fix the test implementation. The issue is that I'm trying to patch `repo.git.push` which doesn't exist yet. Let me fix the tests by using a different mocking approach that works with the GitPython library:Now let me run the tests again to see if they pass:Great! The tests are now passing. Let me run all the code quality checks to ensure everything is working properly:Perfect! All tests are passing and there are no code quality issues. Now let me update the TodoWrite tool to mark Step 1 as completed:Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 1 as complete:## Summary

**Step 1: Implement Git Push Test (TDD)** has been successfully completed!

### What was implemented:

1. **Added two comprehensive test functions** to `tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py`:
   - `test_git_push_basic_workflow()` - Tests basic git push functionality after commit workflow
   - `test_git_push_nothing_to_push()` - Tests git push when remote is already up-to-date

2. **Following TDD principles**:
   - Tests were written first, defining the expected interface and behavior
   - Used proper mocking with `patch('git.cmd.Git.execute')` to avoid network operations
   - Tests expect a return structure of `{"success": bool, "error": str|None}`

3. **Test coverage includes**:
   - Successful push scenario
   - Error handling (no remote, authentication failures)
   - Up-to-date repository scenario
   - Proper git repository validation

4. **Quality verification**:
   - All 428 tests pass (including the 2 new git push tests)
   - No pylint issues
   - No mypy type errors
   - Follows existing code patterns and test structure

The tests are now ready for **Step 2: Implement Git Push Function**, where the actual `git_push()` function will be implemented to make these tests pass with real functionality.

**Commit message**: "Add comprehensive git push workflow tests (TDD)"
