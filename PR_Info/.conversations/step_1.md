Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 1: REMOVED - No Testing Required

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the next task from the TASK_TRACKER.md file. Let me first read the file to understand what needs to be done.Now let me read the specific task details for Step 1:I can see that **Step 1 has been removed** and no implementation is required. The task indicates "REMOVED - No Testing Required" and the step detail confirms this step has been removed from the implementation plan.

Let me update the task tracker to mark Step 1 as complete since it requires no work:## Task Implementation Complete

**Current Task**: Step 1: REMOVED - No Testing Required

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Work Done**: 
- Marked Step 1 as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` 
- Step was already removed from implementation plan - no code changes required

**Commit Message**: 
```
feat: mark step 1 as complete - no testing required

Step 1 was removed from implementation plan per project decisions
```

**Step 1 is now complete**. As specified in the step details, this was removed from the implementation plan and no testing will be implemented for workflows. The task tracker has been updated to reflect completion.

The next task would be **Step 2: Add Project Directory Parameter to Argument Parser**, but you specified to work on only one task, so I've completed Step 1 as requested.
