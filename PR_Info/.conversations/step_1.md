# Implementation Task: Step 1: Core Implementation with Essential Tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 1: Core Implementation with Essential Tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll start by reading the `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` file to understand the current task and then implement it step by step.Now let me read the detailed step 1 requirements:Let me also check the tests readme to understand the testing approach:Now let me understand the project structure better by checking the existing utils directory:I'll start by creating a todo list to track this task and then implement Step 1: Core Implementation with Essential Tests.Now let me check the existing utils structure to understand the patterns:Let me look at an existing utils file to understand the code patterns:Let me also look at existing test patterns:Now let me start implementing the personal config module. Let me mark the first task as in progress and begin implementation:Now I'll implement the personal config module:Now let me mark the first task as complete and start working on the tests:Now let me create the essential unit tests:Now I need to update the utils `__init__.py` file to include our new personal_config module:Now let me mark the tests as complete and start running quality checks:Now let me run the quality checks. Let me start with the unit tests for the personal config module:Great! Now let me run pylint on the new module:The pylint issues are in existing code, not in our new personal_config module. Let me check specifically our new module:Now let me run mypy on the new module:Let me also run pytest on the new test file to make sure it passes with all markers:Perfect! All quality checks are passing. Let me update the todo list to mark the quality checks as complete:Now let me check the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 1 as completed:Let me mark all the Step 1 tasks as completed:Perfect! Step 1 is now completed. Let me provide a concise commit message for this implementation:

**Commit Message:**
```
feat(config): implement personal configuration system

- Add personal_config.py with get_config_file_path() and get_config_value()
- Support platform-specific config paths (~/.mcp_coder/config.toml)
- Add comprehensive unit tests with mocking for isolated testing
- Handle missing files/sections/keys gracefully (return None)
- All quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

## Summary

I have successfully completed **Step 1: Core Implementation with Essential Tests** from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ Implementation Complete:
1. **Personal config module** (`src/mcp_coder/utils/personal_config.py`):
   - `get_config_file_path()` - Platform-specific path resolution
   - `get_config_value()` - TOML config reading with graceful error handling

2. **Essential unit tests** (`tests/utils/test_personal_config.py`):
   - 12 test cases covering platform paths, config retrieval, and error scenarios
   - Proper mocking for isolated testing
   - All edge cases handled (missing file/section/key)

3. **Quality checks passed**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues
   - ✅ Pytest: All 12 tests pass
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

4. **Module integration**: Updated `utils/__init__.py` to export new functions

The implementation follows the project patterns, handles all error cases gracefully, and is ready for the next implementation step.
