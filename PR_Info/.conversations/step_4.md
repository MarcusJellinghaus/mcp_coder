# Implementation Task: Step 4: Update Task Processing and File Operations Functions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 4: Update Task Processing and File Operations Functions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll examine the task tracker to understand the current task and implement it step by step.Now let me check the specific details for Step 4:Now let me look at the current implementation to understand the existing code structure:Now let me also check the test readme to understand which tests to run:I'll implement Step 4 by updating the task processing and file operations functions to accept the `project_dir` parameter. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this work.Now let me start implementing the changes. First, I'll update the `get_next_task()` function:I see the `get_next_task()` function already has the correct signature. Let me mark it as completed and move to the next function:Now let me update the `save_conversation()` function:Now I'll update the `save_conversation()` function to accept `project_dir` as the first parameter and use it for path resolution:Good! Now I need to update the rest of the `save_conversation()` function to also log the absolute path:Now I'll mark `save_conversation()` as completed and move to updating `run_formatters()`:Now I'll update the `commit_changes()` and `push_changes()` functions to use `project_dir` parameter (these are also called from `process_single_task()`):Now I need to update the `process_single_task()` function to accept `project_dir` parameter and pass it to all internal function calls:Now I need to update the `main()` function to pass `project_dir` to `process_single_task()`:Perfect! The `main()` function is already correctly passing `project_dir` to `process_single_task()`. Now let me run the code quality checks to ensure everything is working correctly:Now let me run the pytest checks focusing on unit tests only (avoiding slow integration tests):Excellent! All code quality checks pass. Let me mark the task as completed:Now let me verify that I've completed everything mentioned in the task description by checking the step details again:Perfect! I have successfully completed all the requirements for Step 4. Let me now update the task tracker to mark this step as completed:## Summary

I have successfully completed **Step 4: Update Task Processing and File Operations Functions**. Here's what was implemented:

### ‚úÖ **Completed Tasks:**
1. **Updated function signatures** - All target functions now accept `project_dir: Path` parameter
2. **Updated `save_conversation()`** - Now uses `project_dir / PR_INFO_DIR / ".conversations"` for path resolution
3. **Updated `run_formatters()`** - Now uses `project_dir` instead of `Path.cwd()` 
4. **Updated `commit_changes()` and `push_changes()`** - Both now accept `project_dir` parameter
5. **Updated `process_single_task()`** - All internal function calls now pass `project_dir`
6. **Path resolution fixed** - Conversation directory now resolves relative to `project_dir`

### ‚úÖ **Quality Checks Passed:**
- **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found
- **Mypy**: No type errors found  
- **Pytest**: 377 tests passed (unit tests only, avoiding slow integration tests)

### üìù **Implementation Details:**
- `get_next_task()` already had correct signature and implementation
- `save_conversation()` updated to use `project_dir / PR_INFO_DIR / ".conversations"`
- `run_formatters()` updated to call `format_code(project_dir, ...)` 
- All function call chains properly updated to pass `project_dir` parameter
- Absolute path logging added for saved conversations

The workflow now fully supports the `--project-dir` parameter for task processing and file operations.

### üöÄ **Commit Message:**
`feat(workflows): update task processing functions for project directory support`
