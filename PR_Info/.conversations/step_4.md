# Implementation Task: Step 4 Implementation: Add `get_parent_branch_name()` function to `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 4 Implementation: Add `get_parent_branch_name()` function to `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll start by examining the current task and implementing the `get_parent_branch_name()` function. Let me first look at the task tracker to understand the requirements.Now let me look at the existing git operations file to understand the current structure and patterns:Now let me check the existing tests to understand the expected behavior for the `get_parent_branch_name()` function:Now I'll create a TODO list to track the implementation of the `get_parent_branch_name()` function:Looking at the task requirements and existing tests, I need to implement a `get_parent_branch_name()` function that:

1. Uses simple heuristic: calls `get_main_branch_name()` internally
2. Returns main branch name as parent branch
3. Follows existing logging patterns
4. Delegates validation and error handling to `get_main_branch_name()`

Let me implement this function:Now I need to update the task status and run the code quality checks:Let me run the code quality checks as required by the project instructions:Let me check the test requirements from the readme to run the appropriate tests:Now let me run the git integration tests since my function involves git operations:Let me update my todo list to reflect the current status and run a broader test to ensure I haven't broken anything:Let me run a broader test to ensure the implementation works correctly and doesn't break existing functionality:Perfect! All tests are passing. Let me now update the task tracker to mark Step 4 as complete:## Summary

✅ **Step 4 Implementation Complete**

I have successfully implemented the `get_parent_branch_name()` function in `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py` with the following features:

### Implementation Details:
- **Simple heuristic**: Calls `get_main_branch_name()` internally to return the main branch as the parent branch
- **Proper delegation**: All validation and error handling is delegated to `get_main_branch_name()`
- **Consistent logging**: Follows existing logging patterns with debug messages
- **Return behavior**: Returns "main" or "master" branch name, or None if not found/invalid repo

### Quality Assurance:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **MyPy**: No type errors found  
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 96 tests pass (including the new git integration tests)

### Commit Message:
```
feat: add get_parent_branch_name function to git operations

- Implement simple heuristic using get_main_branch_name internally
- Return main branch as parent branch for all branches
- Follow existing logging and error handling patterns
- Delegate validation to get_main_branch_name function
```

The function is now ready and all tests pass. Step 4 has been marked as complete in the task tracker.
