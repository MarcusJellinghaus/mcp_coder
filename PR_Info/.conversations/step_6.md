Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 6: Update Batch Script

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll examine the TASK_TRACKER.md file to understand the current task and implement it step by step.Now let me examine the current Step 6 details:Now let me examine the current batch script to understand what needs to be updated:Now I'll create a todo list to track the task and then implement Step 6:Now I'll update the `implement.bat` file to include the `--project-dir` parameter:Now let me check the tests readme to see what tests I should run:Since this is just a batch script update with no Python code changes, I'll run a focused set of tests for the relevant functionality. Let me run the code quality checks as required:Let me verify the updated batch script looks correct:Now let me mark the task as complete in the task tracker:**Step 6 Implementation Complete**

I've successfully implemented Step 6: Update Batch Script. Here's what was accomplished:

✅ **Updated `workflows/implement.bat`**:
- Changed `python workflows\implement.py` to `python workflows\implement.py --project-dir .`
- Maintained all existing error handling and pause behavior
- Preserved the user experience while adding project directory support

✅ **Quality Checks Passed**:
- **Pylint**: No issues found
- **Pytest**: 377/433 unit tests passed (excluded slow integration tests as requested)
- **Mypy**: No type errors

✅ **Task Marked Complete**: Updated TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 6 as completed

The batch script now uses the `--project-dir .` parameter, which allows the workflow to run from any location while using the current directory as the project directory. This completes the implementation of project directory support across all workflow components.

**Suggested commit message**: `feat: update batch script for project directory support - Step 6`
