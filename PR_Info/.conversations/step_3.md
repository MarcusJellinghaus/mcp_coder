Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 3: Fix Data Files Log Level from Info to Debug

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement Step 3: Fix Data Files Log Level from Info to Debug. Let me start by examining the task tracker and understanding what needs to be done.Now let me examine the specific details for Step 3:Now let me check the tests readme to understand the testing approach:Now I'll start implementing Step 3. Let me create a todo list and begin by examining the current code:Let me examine the data_files.py file to locate the specific logging line:Perfect! I found the line I need to change. It's on line 165:

```python
structured_logger.info(
    "Found data file in installed package (via importlib)",
    method="importlib_spec",
    path=str(installed_file_absolute),
)
```

Now let me check the existing tests:Now I need to extend the tests with log level verification. Let me add the three test functions as specified in the task:Now let me add the three new test functions at the end of the TestFindDataFile class:Now I need to change the log level in the data_files.py file from info to debug:Perfect! Now let's run the tests to verify our implementation works correctly:I see the issue! The test is failing because my filter function isn't working as expected. The message is showing up as log_level='debug' even when I try to filter it out. Let me fix the test approach. The issue is that structlog's LogCapture captures everything and my filtering doesn't actually prevent the logs from being captured.

Let me fix the test by using a different approach:Now let's run the tests again to see if they pass:Excellent! All tests are now passing. Let's run the pylint and mypy checks:Perfect! All code quality checks pass. Let me mark the final task as completed and update the TASK_TRACKER.md:Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 3 as completed:Perfect! Let me verify that the implementation works correctly by checking the task description once more:## Summary

I have successfully completed **Step 3: Fix Data Files Log Level from Info to Debug**. Here's what was implemented:

### ‚úÖ Changes Made:

1. **Extended tests in `tests/utils/test_data_files.py`** with 3 new test functions:
   - `test_data_file_found_logs_debug_not_info()` - Verifies the message logs at debug level
   - `test_data_file_logging_with_info_level()` - Verifies no INFO level messages appear
   - `test_data_file_logging_with_debug_level()` - Verifies messages appear at DEBUG level

2. **Changed log level in `src/mcp_coder/utils/data_files.py`** (line 187):
   - Changed `structured_logger.info(` to `structured_logger.debug(`
   - Only for the specific message: "Found data file in installed package (via importlib)"
   - No other changes to functionality, message text, or context data

### ‚úÖ Verification Results:

- **All tests pass**: 12/12 tests in `test_data_files.py` 
- **Pylint check**: No issues found
- **Mypy check**: No type errors found

### ‚úÖ Impact:

Now when running workflows:
- **Default (INFO level)**: Will NOT show the data file discovery message (cleaner output)
- **DEBUG level**: Will show the detailed message for debugging purposes
- **All other functionality**: Remains completely unchanged

### üìù Ready for Commit:

**Commit message**: `feat(utils): change data file discovery log level from info to debug`

The task has been marked as completed in `TASK_TRACKER.md`. The implementation exactly matches the requirements - changing only the specified log level while maintaining all existing functionality and adding comprehensive test coverage.
