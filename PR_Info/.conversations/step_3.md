# Implementation Task: Step 3: Export Function and Update Documentation

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 3: Export Function and Update Documentation

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll start by examining the TASK_TRACKER.md file to understand the current task and then implement it step by step.Now let me examine the specific step 3 details:Let me also check tests/readme.md to understand which tests I should run:Now I'll create a todo list and start implementing Step 3:Let me start by examining the current __init__.py file to understand the existing structure:Now I need to add `git_push` to the imports. Let me check what's in the git_operations file to see the exact function name and structure:Perfect! I can see the `git_push` function exists and returns a `dict[str, Any]` (which should really be `PushResult` according to the type alias defined above). Now I'll add it to the __init__.py imports:Now I need to add it to the `__all__` list as well:You're right, let me update the todo list to mark the first task as completed and move to the next one:Now let me check the README.md to see the existing Git Operations section:Now I need to add the git_push usage example to the Git Operations section. I'll add it after the existing commit examples:I also need to add git_push to the imports in the Git Operations section:You're right, let me update the todo list to mark the README task as completed and move to the next one:Now let me run the code quality checks. Based on the tests/readme.md, I should run only the unit tests (not the slow integration tests) for this context:Perfect! All code quality checks are passing. Now let me mark the task as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md:Perfect! Let me verify that Step 3 is completely done by re-reading the task description:## ✅ Step 3 Implementation Complete

**Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md**: Step 3: Export Function and Update Documentation

**What was implemented:**

1. ✅ **Export Function**: Added `git_push` to `src/mcp_coder/__init__.py` public API:
   - Added to import statement from `utils.git_operations`
   - Added to `__all__` list for public API export
   - Placed alphabetically with existing git operations

2. ✅ **Documentation**: Added complete commit + push workflow example to README.md:
   - Added `git_push` to imports in Git Operations section  
   - Added practical usage example showing commit → push workflow
   - Included proper error handling pattern
   - Maintained consistency with existing documentation style

3. ✅ **Quality Checks**: All code quality checks pass:
   - **Pylint**: No issues found
   - **Pytest**: 374/428 tests passed (ran unit tests only per context requirements)
   - **Mypy**: No type errors found

4. ✅ **Task Tracking**: Updated TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 3 as complete

**Suggested commit message**: `feat: export git_push function and add documentation`

The implementation follows existing patterns, maintains code consistency, and includes comprehensive examples for users. Step 3 is now complete and ready for the next phase.
