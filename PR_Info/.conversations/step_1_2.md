# Implementation Task: Step 1: Add Argument Parsing and Basic Logging Setup

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 1: Add Argument Parsing and Basic Logging Setup

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the task tracker to understand what needs to be implemented and then work on Step 1: Add Argument Parsing and Basic Logging Setup.Now let me look at the details for Step 1:Now let me look at the current implementation file to understand the structure:Great! I can see that Step 1 has already been implemented in the `workflows/implement.py` file. The code already has:

1. ✅ `parse_arguments()` function that creates an argument parser with `--log-level` parameter
2. ✅ Choices for log levels: `["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"]`
3. ✅ Default value set to `"INFO"`
4. ✅ Modified `main()` function that calls `parse_arguments()` and `setup_logging(args.log_level)`
5. ✅ Proper imports for `argparse` and `setup_logging`

Let me verify that this implementation works by running the manual verification tests:The command timed out, but that's expected since it would try to connect to the LLM service. The important thing is that we can see the logging is working correctly - it shows "Logging initialized: console=DEBUG" which confirms the argument parsing and logging setup is working. Let me test with an invalid argument:Perfect! The argument parsing is working correctly - it properly rejects invalid log levels with an appropriate error message.Now let me run the required code quality checks:Let me check the test readme to understand what tests to run:Since this is workflow-level code and the task mentions "manual verification only for workflow", I should run the fast unit tests only to avoid long-running integration tests:All checks have passed! Now I need to mark Step 1 as complete in the task tracker. Let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md file:Perfect! **Step 1: Add Argument Parsing and Basic Logging Setup** has been completed successfully. 

## Summary

Step 1 was already implemented in `workflows/implement.py:25-33` and `workflows/implement.py:267-276`. The implementation includes:

✅ **Argument parsing function** (`parse_arguments()`) with `--log-level` parameter  
✅ **Logging setup** integrated into `main()` function using `setup_logging(args.log_level)`  
✅ **Manual verification** confirmed - help shows parameter, DEBUG works, invalid values rejected  
✅ **All code quality checks passed** - pylint, pytest (374/428 unit tests), and mypy  
✅ **Task marked complete** in `TASK_TRACKER.md`

**Commit message**: `feat(workflows): add argument parsing and logging setup`

The implementation follows the requirements exactly:
- Uses `argparse` with choices `["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"]`
- Default value is `"INFO"`  
- Calls `setup_logging()` early in `main()`
- Preserves all existing workflow functionality
- Handles invalid arguments automatically via argparse
