# Task Status Tracker

## Instructions for LLM

This tracks **Feature Implementation** consisting of multiple **Implementation Steps** (tasks).

**Development Process:** See [DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md) for detailed workflow, prompts, and tools.

**How to update tasks:**
1. Change [ ] to [x] when implementation step is fully complete (code + checks pass)
2. Change [x] to [ ] if task needs to be reopened
3. Add brief notes in the linked detail files if needed
4. Keep it simple - just GitHub-style checkboxes

**Task format:**
- [x] = Implementation step complete (code + all checks pass)
- [ ] = Implementation step not complete
- Each task links to a detail file in PR_Info/ folder

## Tasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] **Step 1: Create Test Directory Structure** - [step_1.md](./steps/step_1.md)

  - [ ] Add __init__.py files for Python package recognition
  - [ ] Run pylint check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest to verify structure doesn't break existing tests
  - [ ] Run mypy check and fix any type issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit with descriptive message

- [ ] **Step 2: Move Claude Provider Test Files** - [step_2.md](./steps/step_2.md)
  - [ ] Move all Claude test files from tests/ root to tests/llm_providers/claude/
  - [ ] Preserve all file content during move operation
  - [ ] Run pylint check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest to verify files are discoverable in new location
  - [ ] Run mypy check and fix any type issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit with descriptive message

- [ ] **Step 3: Update Import Statements in Moved Test Files** - [step_3.md](./steps/step_3.md)
  - [ ] Fix import paths in all moved Claude test files
  - [ ] Ensure all mcp_coder.* imports work from new nested location
  - [ ] Run pylint check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest to verify imports resolve correctly
  - [ ] Run mypy check and fix any type issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit with descriptive message

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify Test Functionality and Run Validation** - [step_4.md](./steps/step_4.md)
  - [ ] Run comprehensive pytest validation on reorganized structure
  - [ ] Verify all tests are discoverable and executable
  - [ ] Confirm test count matches original before reorganization
  - [ ] Run pylint check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Run mypy check and fix any type issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit with descriptive message

- [ ] **Step 5: Final Documentation and Cleanup** - [step_5.md](./steps/step_5.md)
  - [ ] Create completion report documenting before/after structure
  - [ ] Verify all objectives from summary were achieved
  - [ ] Document final test directory structure
  - [ ] Run pylint check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest final validation
  - [ ] Run mypy check and fix any type issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit with descriptive message

### Feature Completion

- [ ] **PR Review**
  - [ ] Run comprehensive code review using tools/pr_review.bat
  - [ ] Address any issues identified in PR review
  - [ ] Verify all implementation steps are complete
  - [ ] Ensure code quality standards are met

- [ ] **Summary Creation**
