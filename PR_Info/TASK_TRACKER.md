# Task Status Tracker

## Instructions for LLM

This tracks **Feature Implementation** consisting of multiple **Implementation Steps** (tasks).

**Development Process:** See [DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md) for detailed workflow, prompts, and tools.

**How to update tasks:**
1. Change [ ] to [x] when implementation step is fully complete (code + checks pass)
2. Change [x] to [ ] if task needs to be reopened
3. Add brief notes in the linked detail files if needed
4. Keep it simple - just GitHub-style checkboxes

**Task format:**
- [x] = Implementation step complete (code + all checks pass)
- [ ] = Implementation step not complete
- Each task links to a detail file in PR_Info/ folder

## Tasks

### Implementation Steps

- [x] **Step 1: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies** - [step_1.md](steps/step_1.md)  
  Set up the project structure for the refactored LLM interface and add claude-code-sdk dependency
  - [x] Add claude-code-sdk to pyproject.toml dependencies
  - [x] Create project structure for implementation plan
  - [x] Run pylint quality check and fix any issues
  - [x] Run pytest to ensure existing tests pass
  - [x] Run mypy type checking and resolve any issues
  - [x] Prepare git commit for project setup changes

- [x] **Step 2: Move CLI Implementation to Dedicated Module** - [step_2.md](steps/step_2.md)  
  Extract existing CLI-based Claude Code implementation into dedicated claude_code_cli.py module
  - [x] Create src/mcp_coder/claude_code_cli.py with moved implementation
  - [x] Update src/mcp_coder/claude_client.py as compatibility wrapper
  - [x] Move and update existing tests to test_claude_code_cli.py

  - [x] Prepare git commit for high-level interface implementation

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement Basic Python SDK Client** - [step_4.md](steps/step_4.md)  
  Create Python SDK implementation providing same functionality as CLI version
  - [ ] Create src/mcp_coder/claude_code_api.py with SDK implementation

  - [ ] Update integration tests to include API method testing
  - [ ] Run pylint quality check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest to ensure API implementation works correctly
  - [ ] Run mypy type checking and resolve any issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit for Python SDK implementation

- [ ] **Step 5: Comprehensive Testing and Validation** - [step_5.md](steps/step_5.md)  
  Ensure refactored architecture works correctly with comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Create tests/test_integration_full.py with essential integration tests
  - [ ] Create tests/test_backward_compatibility.py for compatibility validation
  - [ ] Add parameterized tests comparing CLI and API methods
  - [ ] Update existing test files with additional edge cases
  - [ ] Run pylint quality check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest to ensure all functionality works correctly
  - [ ] Run mypy type checking and resolve any issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit for comprehensive testing suite

- [ ] **Step 6: Essential Documentation** - [step_6.md](steps/step_6.md)  
  Document the completed refactoring work with essential usage examples
  - [ ] Update README.md with new usage examples and API documentation
  - [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all new functions
  - [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md documenting refactoring changes
  - [ ] Update src/mcp_coder/__init__.py with docstrings for exports
  - [ ] Run pylint quality check and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run pytest to verify documentation examples work
  - [ ] Run mypy type checking and resolve any issues
  - [ ] Prepare git commit for documentation updates
