## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
*Changes that can be implemented quickly with high impact*

1. **Add Markers from pyproject.toml**
   - See `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section for marker definitions
   - Add appropriate markers to slow tests based on their category
   - Follow marker usage guidelines in pyproject.toml

2. **Optimize Specific Tests**
   - [Test name]: [Specific optimization]
   - [Test name]: [Specific optimization]

3. **Implement CI Optimizations**
   ```bash
   # Fast CI pipeline (from pyproject.toml)
   pytest -m "not git_integration and not claude_integration"
   
   # Full test run
   pytest
   
   # Integration test groups
   pytest -m "git_integration or claude_integration"
   ```

### Medium-Term Actions
*Changes requiring more planning and effort*

1. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Database fixture optimization
   - Mock service implementations
   - Shared test data setup

2. **Test Refactoring**
   - Split large integration tests
   - Improve test isolation
   - Reduce test dependencies

### Long-Term Actions
*Strategic improvements for test architecture*

1. **Test Strategy Review**
   - Balance unit vs integration tests
   - Test pyramid optimization
   - Performance monitoring integration

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Optimization**
   - Parallel test execution
   - Smart test selection
   - Performance regression detection

## Monitoring & Measurement

### Performance Metrics to Track
- Total test suite execution time
- Number of tests >2 seconds
- Number of tests >10 seconds
- CI pipeline duration
- Test flakiness related to timeouts

### Regular Analysis Schedule
- **Weekly**: Quick performance check
- **Monthly**: Full analysis and inventory update
- **Quarterly**: Strategy review and optimization planning

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Add markers to identified slow tests
- [ ] Implement CI exclusion patterns
- [ ] Optimize top 3 slowest tests

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Week 3-6)
- [ ] Improve test fixtures
- [ ] Implement better mocking
- [ ] Database test optimizations

### Phase 3: Strategic (Month 2-3)
- [ ] Test architecture review
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline improvements
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup

## Success Metrics

### Target Improvements
- **Overall test suite time**: Reduce by [X]%
- **CI pipeline time**: Reduce by [X]%
- **Tests >10 seconds**: Reduce to [X] tests
- **Developer feedback**: Improved test iteration speed

### Measurement Plan
- Baseline measurements before changes
- Weekly tracking during implementation
- Before/after comparison for each optimization
