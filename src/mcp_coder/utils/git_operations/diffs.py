    Generate comprehensive git diff without modifying repository state.

    Shows staged, unstaged, and untracked files in unified diff format
    suitable for LLM analysis and commit message generation.

    Args:
        project_dir: Path to the project directory containing git repository

    Returns:
        str: Unified diff format with sections for staged changes, unstaged
             changes, and untracked files. Each section uses format:
             === SECTION NAME ===

             Returns empty string if no changes detected.
        None: If error occurs (invalid repository, git command failure, etc.)

    Example:
        >>> diff_output = get_git_diff_for_commit(Path("/path/to/repo"))
