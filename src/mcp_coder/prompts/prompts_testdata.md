# MCP Coder Prompts - TEST DATA

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This file contains test data for development and testing purposes only.**

This file serves as a test case for the prompt manager functionality. It contains sample prompts with mixed content to test various features of the prompt management system.

**Note**: This is not a production prompt library - it's specifically created to test mixed content handling, different header levels, and validation functionality.

## Test Documentation Section A

This is a documentation section without a code block to test validation.

### Test Subsection A1

More documentation content for testing.

# Test Prompt AAA
```
[TEST PROMPT]
This is test prompt AAA for basic functionality testing.
Keep responses under 50 characters.
```

## Test Documentation Section B

Another documentation section for testing mixed content handling.

# Test Prompt BBB
```
[TEST PROMPT]
This is test prompt BBB for detailed functionality testing.
Include rationale and context.
Explain the reasoning behind decisions.
```

### Test Subsection B1

Subsection documentation for testing header level detection.

#### Test Subsection B2

Deeper nesting level for testing.

# Test Prompt CCC
```
[TEST PROMPT]
This is test prompt CCC for code review testing.
Focus on:
- Code quality
- Potential issues
- Best practices
```

## Test Documentation Section C

Final documentation section.

# Test Prompt DDD
```
[TEST PROMPT]
This is test prompt DDD for performance analysis.
Analyze:
1. Bottlenecks
2. Optimization opportunities
3. Trade-offs
```

##### Test Subsection C1

Testing level 5 headers.

# Test Prompt EEE
```
[TEST PROMPT]
This is test prompt EEE for feature planning.
Create implementation plan with:
1. Requirements
2. Technical approach
3. Timeline
```

## Conclusion

This test file validates the prompt manager functionality including:
- Mixed content handling (documentation + prompts)
- Various header levels (#, ##, ###, ####, #####)
- Validation of markdown structure
- Cross-file duplicate detection
- File path, directory, and wildcard access patterns

**Testing Note**: This file intentionally contains documentation headers without code blocks to test the validation system's mixed content handling.
