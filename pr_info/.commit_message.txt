feat(commands): add implementation_finalise slash command

Add new slash command for manual invocation of the finalisation process
that completes unchecked tasks in TASK_TRACKER.md before code review.

The command:
- Identifies and processes unchecked tasks from the task tracker
- Auto-marks commit message tasks if commits already exist
- Works without step files by analysing task names and codebase
- Runs quality checks only if code changes were made
- Writes commit message to pr_info/.commit_message.txt
- Does not auto-push (manual use only)
