refactor(deps): restructure optional dependencies into purpose-specific groups

Split the monolithic `dev` optional dependency group into four purpose-specific
groups to enable selective installation in automated workflows:

- `types`: Type stubs (types-pyperclip, types-requests) - required in project
  venv for mypy type resolution
- `test`: Test utilities (pytest-asyncio, pytest-xdist) - for local development
- `mcp`: MCP servers (mcp-server-filesystem) - for local development
- `dev`: Meta-group combining all above via self-reference

This separation allows Jenkins workflows to install only type stubs in the
project environment (`uv sync --extra types`) while keeping test and MCP
dependencies in the pre-provisioned execution environment.

Backward compatible: `pip install .[dev]` continues to install all dependencies.
