# Task Status Tracker

## Instructions for LLM

This tracks **Feature Implementation** consisting of multiple **Implementation Steps** (tasks).

**Development Process:** See [DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md) for detailed workflow, prompts, and tools.

**How to update tasks:**
1. Change [ ] to [x] when implementation step is fully complete (code + checks pass)
2. Change [x] to [ ] if task needs to be reopened
3. Add brief notes in the linked detail files if needed
4. Keep it simple - just GitHub-style checkboxes

**Task format:**
- [x] = Implementation step complete (code + all checks pass)
- [ ] = Implementation step not complete
- Each task links to a detail file in PR_Info/ folder

[ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 8

### Step 9: Integration and Module Export
[ ] Update __init__.py to export IssueManager
[ ] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy
[ ] Fix all issues found by quality checks
[ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 9

### Step 10: Comprehensive Integration Tests
[ ] Add integration tests for multiple issues filtering
[ ] Add integration tests for label edge cases
