# Task Status Tracker

## Instructions for LLM

This tracks **Feature Implementation** consisting of multiple **Implementation Steps** (tasks).

**Development Process:** See [DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md) for detailed workflow, prompts, and tools.

**How to update tasks:**
1. Change [ ] to [x] when implementation step is fully complete (code + checks pass)
2. Change [x] to [ ] if task needs to be reopened
3. Add brief notes in the linked detail files if needed
4. Keep it simple - just GitHub-style checkboxes

**Task format:**
- [x] = Implementation step complete (code + all checks pass)
- [ ] = Implementation step not complete
- Each task links to a detail file in PR_Info/ folder

## Tasks

### Step 1: Create Workflow Package Structure and Basic Tests
- [x] Create workflow package structure under src/mcp_coder/workflows/
- [x] Set up test infrastructure for comprehensive unit testing
- [x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - and work on all issues found
- [x] Prepare git commit message for Step 1

### Step 2: Implement Prerequisites Module with Tests
- [x] Create tests/workflows/implement/test_prerequisites.py (test-first approach)
- [x] Create src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/prerequisites.py
- [x] Extract prerequisites logic with git status, branch checking, project validation
- [x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - and work on all issues found
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 2

### Step 3: Implement Task Processing Module with Tests
- [x] Create tests/workflows/implement/test_task_processing.py (test-first approach)
- [x] Create src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/task_processing.py
- [x] Extract task processing logic with LLM integration, mypy fixes, formatting
- [x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - and work on all issues found
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 3

### Step 4: Implement Core Workflow Orchestration with Tests
- [x] Create tests/workflows/implement/test_core.py (test-first approach)
- [x] Create src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py
- [x] Extract main workflow orchestration logic
- [x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - and work on all issues found
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 4

### Step 5: Implement CLI Command Interface with Tests
- [x] Create tests/cli/commands/test_implement.py (test-first approach)
- [x] Create src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/implement.py
- [x] Update src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py and commands/__init__.py
- [x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - and work on all issues found
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 5

### Step 6: Integration Testing and Cleanup
- [x] Run all code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- [x] Verify `mcp-coder implement` command works end-to-end
- [ ] Delete workflows/implement.py and workflows/implement.bat
- [ ] Update workflow exports in __init__.py files
- [ ] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - and work on all issues found
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 6

## Pull Request
