# Task Status Tracker

## Instructions for LLM

This tracks **Feature Implementation** consisting of multiple **Implementation Steps** (tasks).

**Development Process:** See [DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md) for detailed workflow, prompts, and tools.

**How to update tasks:**
1. Change [ ] to [x] when implementation step is fully complete (code + checks pass)
2. Change [x] to [ ] if task needs to be reopened
3. Add brief notes in the linked detail files if needed
4. Keep it simple - just GitHub-style checkboxes

**Task format:**
- [x] = Implementation step complete (code + all checks pass)
- [ ] = Implementation step not complete
- Each task links to a detail file in PR_Info/ folder

[x] Prepare git commit message for Step 11

### Step 12: Apply Decorator to IssueManager Methods
[x] Apply decorator to all 10 IssueManager methods
[x] Remove bare Exception catch blocks
[x] Run unit tests to verify behavior unchanged
[x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy
[x] Fix all issues found by quality checks
[x] Prepare git commit message for Step 12

### Step 13: Apply Decorator to PullRequestManager Methods
[x] Apply decorator to all 4 PullRequestManager methods
[x] Remove debug logging lines (e.status, e.data)
[x] Remove bare Exception catch blocks
[x] Run unit tests to verify behavior unchanged
[x] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy
[x] Fix all issues found by quality checks
[x] Prepare git commit message for Step 13

### Step 14: Apply Decorator to LabelsManager Methods
[ ] Apply decorator to all 5 LabelsManager methods
[ ] Remove bare Exception catch blocks
[ ] Run unit tests to verify behavior unchanged
[ ] Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy
[ ] Fix all issues found by quality checks
[ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 14

### Step 15: Update Tests for New Error Handling
[ ] Update test_claude_code_api_error_handling.py expectations
[ ] Remove tests for bare Exception handling if any exist
[ ] Run full test suite to identify failures
[ ] Fix test expectations (not implementation)
