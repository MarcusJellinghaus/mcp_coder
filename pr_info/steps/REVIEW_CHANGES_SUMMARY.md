## Critical Changes Made

### 1. Exception Types Consistency (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Inconsistency between Decision 4 (single exception) and implementation steps (multiple exceptions)

**Changes:**
- **decisions.md**: Added Decision 12 confirming single JenkinsError only
- **summary.md**: Added note that only JenkinsError is exported
- **step_2.md**: Added note about single exception type, updated docstring
- **step_4.md**: Added note about single exception export
- **step_5.md**: Updated requirements to test single exception only

**Result:** Plan now consistently uses only `JenkinsError` throughout.

---

### 2. Exception Chaining Added
**Decision 17**: Use `raise JenkinsError(...) from e` to preserve tracebacks

**Changes:**
- **summary.md**: Added exception chaining to error handling pattern
- **step_2.md**: 
  - Updated JenkinsError docstring to mention exception chaining
  - Updated start_job() algorithm to show exception chaining syntax
  - Updated get_job_status() algorithm to show exception chaining syntax

**Result:** All error handling now preserves original exceptions for debugging.

---

### 3. Parameters Validation Added
**Decision 20**: Validate that params is a dict in start_job()

**Changes:**
- **summary.md**: Added params validation to error handling pattern
- **step_2.md**:
  - Updated start_job() docstring to document ValueError
  - Updated start_job() algorithm to include validation step
- **step_5.md**: Updated error handling requirements checklist

**Result:** start_job() now validates params type before calling Jenkins API.

---

### 4. Duration Availability Documented
**Decision 21**: duration_ms is None until job completes

**Changes:**
- **step_1.md**: Added note that duration_ms becomes available only after completion
- **step_2.md**: Updated get_job_status() algorithm to clarify duration_ms behavior

**Result:** Clear documentation of when duration_ms has a value.

---

### 5. Jenkins Version Documentation Removed
**Decision 14**: Do not document Jenkins version at all

**Changes:**
- **decisions.md**: 
  - Marked Decision 11 as SUPERSEDED
  - Added Decision 14 with new approach
- **step_2.md**: Removed "Tested with Jenkins 2.4xx series" from module docstring

**Result:** No Jenkins version documentation anywhere.

---

### 6. Timeout Documentation Moved
**Decision 19**: Document timeout in class docstring, not module docstring

**Changes:**
- **step_2.md**:
  - Moved "30-second timeout" note from module docstring limitations to __init__ docstring
  - Removed thread safety and timeout from module limitations
  - Added queue item expiration to module limitations

**Result:** Timeout documented where users instantiate the class.

---

### 7. URL Source Clarified
**Decision 22**: Get URL from Jenkins API only, don't construct

**Changes:**
- **step_1.md**: Clarified url comes "from API"
- **step_2.md**: Updated get_job_status() algorithm to specify "from API"

**Result:** Clear that URLs come from Jenkins, not constructed by client.

---

### 8. Edge Cases Documented
**Decisions 15, 16**: How to handle expired queue items and missing build numbers

**Changes:**
- **step_2.md**: Added notes to get_job_status() algorithm:
  - Expired/purged queue items fail naturally
  - build_number stays None if job never starts
  - URL from API, not constructed

**Result:** Clear behavior for edge cases.

---

### 9. Complexity Estimate Updated
**Decision 28**: Remove specific line counts, use "moderate complexity"

**Changes:**
- **summary.md**: Replaced specific line counts (450-550) with complexity level description

**Result:** More flexible estimate focused on complexity level.

---

## Decisions Logged

Added 18 new decisions (Decision 12-29) from review discussion:

- **Decision 12**: Exception types consistency
- **Decision 13**: Keep detailed test specifications
- **Decision 14**: No Jenkins version documentation
- **Decision 15**: Let queue expiration fail naturally
- **Decision 16**: Pass through None for missing build_number
- **Decision 17**: Use exception chaining
- **Decision 18**: No rate limiting handling
- **Decision 19**: Document timeout in class docstring
- **Decision 20**: Validate params is dict
- **Decision 21**: Document duration_ms availability
- **Decision 22**: Get URL from Jenkins API
- **Decision 23**: No troubleshooting section
- **Decision 24**: No quick start example
- **Decision 25**: No performance documentation
- **Decision 26**: Line counts sufficient
- **Decision 27**: No rollback plan
- **Decision 28**: Remove specific line counts
- **Decision 29**: Keep current scope

## Validation

All changes were targeted and surgical:
- Used `edit_file` for precise changes
- Preserved existing content and structure
- Only modified what was discussed
- No invented decisions or changes

**Plan is now consistent and ready for implementation.**
