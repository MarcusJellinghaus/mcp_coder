# Implementation Decisions

## Decision Log

This document tracks decisions made during the planning phase.

---

### 1. TDD Approach: Keep Steps 1 & 2 Separate
**Decision:** Maintain strict TDD separation with Step 1 (tests) and Step 2 (implementation) as separate steps.  
**Rationale:** Clear TDD discipline, separate concerns.  
**Alternative Considered:** Combine into single step (rejected for less strict TDD).

---

### 2. Test Updates: Update Existing Tests Only
**Decision:** Only update existing tests to match new behavior. Do not add new tests.  
**Rationale:** This is a refactoring, not new functionality. Existing test coverage is sufficient.  
**Alternative Considered:** Add explicit lazy verification test (rejected as unnecessary).

---

### 3. Documentation: Remove Step 4
**Decision:** Remove documentation step entirely. This is a minor detail refactoring.  
**Rationale:** Documentation overhead not justified for this optimization.  
**Impact:** Architecture docs and performance tracking will not be updated.

---

### 4. Pseudocode: One Concise Block Per Step
**Decision:** Each step should have one concise pseudocode block showing core logic only.  
**Rationale:** KISS principle - keep it simple and small.  
**Alternative Considered:** Multiple pseudocode blocks for different aspects (rejected as redundant).

---

### 5. LLM Prompts: Keep Detailed
**Decision:** Maintain detailed LLM prompts at the start of each step.  
**Rationale:** Thorough context and instructions aid implementation.  
**Alternative Considered:** Simplified prompts (rejected).

---

### 6. CLINotFoundError Import: Proceed As Planned
**Decision:** Use `from claude_code_sdk._errors import CLINotFoundError` without verification.  
**Rationale:** Import exists and is usable. Fix if issues arise during implementation.  
**Note:** The underscore in `_errors` suggests private API, but we accept the risk.

---

### 7. Performance Measurement: Skip It
**Decision:** No performance measurement needed.  
**Rationale:** This is a refactoring. Tests passing faster is sufficient validation.  
**Impact:** No baseline measurement, no performance tables, no detailed metrics.

---

### 8. Error Handling Enhancement
**Decision:** When SDK fails and verification runs, raise RuntimeError with BOTH SDK message AND verification details.  
**Additional Enhancements:**
- Add file existence check in error path
- Implement extensive logging (DEBUG for success, ERROR with full context for failures)
- Provide both our analysis AND CLI's original error message  

**Rationale:** Users get complete context for troubleshooting.

---

### 9. Step 3 Validation: Run Integration Tests Only
**Decision:** Step 3 should only run integration tests and verify they pass.  
**Rationale:** Performance measurement skipped (Decision 7). Sanity checks not needed.  
**Removed:** Performance tables, manual testing, troubleshooting sections.

---

### 10. Test Structure Verification
**Decision:** Add note to verify test file locations match code structure during implementation.  
**Rationale:** Ensure tests follow proper folder structure.

---

### 11. Quick Win Section: Not Needed
**Decision:** Do not add a "Quick Win" summary section.  
**Rationale:** Detailed steps are sufficient. Keep plan focused.

## Summary of Changes

**Simplified:**
- Removed Step 4 (documentation)
- Removed new test in Step 1 (update existing only)
- Simplified Step 3 (just run integration tests)
- One pseudocode block per step

**Enhanced:**
- Better error handling (both SDK + verification messages)
- File existence check in error path
- Extensive logging strategy

**Kept As-Is:**
- Separate Steps 1 & 2 (TDD)
- Detailed LLM prompts
- All other structural elements
