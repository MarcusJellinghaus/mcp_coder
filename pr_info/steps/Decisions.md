# Implementation Decisions

This document records decisions made during plan review discussions.

---

## Decision 1: Step 2 Execution Order
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should tests be updated before or after creating modules?

**Decision:** Create modules first, then update tests (Option B)

**Rationale:** Provides smoother workflow with immediate test success rather than intentional failure cycle.

**Impact:** Step 2 Part A and Part B will be reordered.

---

## Decision 2: Keep Steps 4 and 5 Separate
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should Steps 4 (update test imports) and 5 (cleanup/validation) be merged?

**Decision:** Keep as 2 separate steps (Option A)

**Rationale:** Maintains clear 5-step structure with distinct responsibilities.

**Impact:** No change to step structure.

---

## Decision 3: Error Handling - Return Codes
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** What should `run_create_pr_workflow()` return when PR succeeds but cleanup fails?

**Decision:** Add return code 2 for partial success (Option C)

**Return codes:**
- 0: Complete success (PR created and cleanup completed)
- 1: Error (PR creation failed or prerequisites failed)
- 2: Partial success (PR created successfully but cleanup failed)

**Impact:** Function signature documentation and implementation logic in Step 2.

---

## Decision 4: Edge Case Test Coverage
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we add tests for edge cases (None arguments, invalid methods, multiple calls, partial failures)?

**Decision:** Document as future enhancement (Option C)

**Rationale:** Current test coverage is adequate for initial implementation. Edge cases can be added later.

**Impact:** No changes to test plan. Can be addressed in future iterations.

---

## Decision 5: Documentation Structure
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** How to handle repeated content across summary.md and step files?

**Decision:** Middle ground - core concepts in summary, step-specific details in steps (Option C)

**Rationale:** Balance between avoiding redundancy and maintaining step file independence.

**Impact:** Minor adjustments to reduce repetition while keeping essential context in each file.

---

## Decision 6: No Quick Start Section
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we add a Quick Start section to summary.md?

**Decision:** No (Option C)

**Rationale:** Keep summary.md focused on architecture.

**Impact:** No changes needed.

---

## Decision 7: No Troubleshooting Section
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we add troubleshooting guidance?

**Decision:** No (Option C)

**Rationale:** Developers can resolve issues as they arise.

**Impact:** No changes needed.

---

## Decision 8: No Backwards Compatibility Handling
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we handle backwards compatibility for `workflows/create_PR.py`?

**Decision:** No special handling (Option C)

**Rationale:** Internal script, breaking changes are acceptable.

**Impact:** Direct deletion in Step 5 without deprecation warnings.

---

## Decision 9: Configuration - Future Enhancement
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should workflow support config file defaults (e.g., default LLM method)?

**Decision:** Document as future enhancement (Option C)

**Rationale:** Keep initial implementation simple, add configuration later if needed.

**Impact:** No changes to current implementation.

---

## Decision 10: Use Existing Logging Configuration
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should CLI command support `--verbose` flag?

**Decision:** Use existing logging configuration (Option B)

**Rationale:** Leverage existing logging infrastructure rather than adding command-specific flag.

**Impact:** No changes needed.

---

## Decision 11: Delete Legacy Test Shim
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** What to do with `tests/test_create_pr.py` (backwards compatibility shim)?

**Decision:** Delete it in Step 5 (Option B)

**Rationale:** It's just a re-export shim; actual tests are in organized modules.

**Impact:** Add `tests/test_create_pr.py` to deletion list in Step 5.

---

## Decision 12: Keep Step 4 Scope As-Is
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Since legacy test file will be deleted, should Step 4 be merged elsewhere?

**Decision:** Keep Step 4 as-is (Option A)

**Rationale:** Step 4 focuses on integration test updates, which is still a distinct task.

**Impact:** Step 4 only updates `tests/workflows/test_create_pr_integration.py` (not the legacy shim).
