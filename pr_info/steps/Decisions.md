# Implementation Decisions

## Decisions Made During Plan Review

### 1. Step 1 Scope Reduction
**Decision:** Modify Step 1 to focus only on adding the `github_integration` test marker
**Rationale:** PyGithub dependency was already installed outside the implementation plan
**Choice:** Option B - Keep Step 1 but only for the test marker addition

### 2. Configuration Key Naming
**Decision:** Use `github.test_repo_url` instead of `github.repo_url_integration_tests`
**Rationale:** Shorter and cleaner while still being clear
**Choice:** Option B - Change to `github.test_repo_url`

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision:** Keep empty dict `{}` return on all errors
**Rationale:** Simple, consistent, safe approach that follows KISS principle
**Choice:** Option A - Keep `{}` return on all errors

### 4. Test Repository Setup Guidance
**Decision:** Enhance configuration example with comment showing expected repo URL format
**Rationale:** Provides guidance without adding complexity
**Choice:** Option D - Add comment in configuration example

### 5. Test Branch Cleanup
**Decision:** Add cleanup logic to delete test branch after closing PR
**Rationale:** Prevents test branch accumulation in repository
**Choice:** Option A - Add cleanup logic to the test itself
