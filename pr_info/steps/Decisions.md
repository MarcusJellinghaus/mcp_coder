# Implementation Decisions

This document records decisions made during plan review discussions.

---

## Decision 1: Step 2 Execution Order
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should tests be updated before or after creating modules?

**Decision:** Create modules first, then update tests (Option B)

**Rationale:** Provides smoother workflow with immediate test success rather than intentional failure cycle.

**Impact:** Step 2 Part A and Part B will be reordered.

---

## Decision 2: Keep Steps 4 and 5 Separate
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should Steps 4 (update test imports) and 5 (cleanup/validation) be merged?

**Decision:** Keep as 2 separate steps (Option A)

**Rationale:** Maintains clear 5-step structure with distinct responsibilities.

**Impact:** No change to step structure.

---

## Decision 3: Error Handling - Return Codes (REVISED)
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21 (Revised same day)

**Question:** Should we use simple binary success/failure or include partial success return code?

**Decision:** Simplify to binary return codes (Option B)

**Return codes:**
- 0: Success (PR created and cleanup completed)
- 1: Failure (any error during workflow)

**Rationale:** KISS principle - simpler error handling for MVP. Partial success handling adds unnecessary complexity.

**Impact:** Function signature documentation and implementation logic in Step 2.

---

## Decision 4: Edge Case Test Coverage
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we add tests for edge cases (None arguments, invalid methods, multiple calls, partial failures)?

**Decision:** Document as future enhancement (Option C)

**Rationale:** Current test coverage is adequate for initial implementation. Edge cases can be added later.

**Impact:** No changes to test plan. Can be addressed in future iterations.

---

## Decision 5: Documentation Structure (REVISED)
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21 (Revised same day)

**Question:** How to handle repeated content across summary.md and step files?

**Decision:** Steps reference summary.md for architecture, include only step-specific details (Option A)

**Rationale:** Reduce repetition following KISS principle. Summary.md contains architecture, steps contain implementation details.

**Impact:** Step files will start with "See summary.md for architecture" and avoid repeating architectural context.

---

## Decision 6: No Quick Start Section
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we add a Quick Start section to summary.md?

**Decision:** No (Option C)

**Rationale:** Keep summary.md focused on architecture.

**Impact:** No changes needed.

---

## Decision 7: No Troubleshooting Section
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we add troubleshooting guidance?

**Decision:** No (Option C)

**Rationale:** Developers can resolve issues as they arise.

**Impact:** No changes needed.

---

## Decision 8: No Backwards Compatibility Handling
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should we handle backwards compatibility for `workflows/create_PR.py`?

**Decision:** No special handling (Option C)

**Rationale:** Internal script, breaking changes are acceptable.

**Impact:** Direct deletion in Step 5 without deprecation warnings.

---

## Decision 9: Configuration - Future Enhancement
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should workflow support config file defaults (e.g., default LLM method)?

**Decision:** Document as future enhancement (Option C)

**Rationale:** Keep initial implementation simple, add configuration later if needed.

**Impact:** No changes to current implementation.

---

## Decision 10: Use Existing Logging Configuration
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should CLI command support `--verbose` flag?

**Decision:** Use existing logging configuration (Option B)

**Rationale:** Leverage existing logging infrastructure rather than adding command-specific flag.

**Impact:** No changes needed.

---

## Decision 11: Delete Legacy Test Shim (REVISED)
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21 (Revised same day)

**Question:** When should we delete `tests/test_create_pr.py` (backwards compatibility shim)?

**Decision:** Delete it in Step 2 after new structure is validated (Option B)

**Rationale:** It's just a re-export shim; can be removed once new modules exist. No need to maintain it through Steps 3-4.

**Impact:** Add `tests/test_create_pr.py` to deletion list in Step 2, remove from Step 5 deletion list.

---

## Decision 12: Keep Step 4 Scope As-Is
**Date:** Discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Since legacy test file will be deleted, should Step 4 be merged elsewhere?

**Decision:** Keep Step 4 as-is (Option A)

**Rationale:** Step 4 focuses on integration test updates, which is still a distinct task.

**Impact:** Step 4 only updates `tests/workflows/test_create_pr_integration.py` (not the legacy shim).

---

## Decision 13: Step 4 Title Simplification
**Date:** Plan revision discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should Step 4 title reflect that it only updates integration tests?

**Decision:** Rename to "Update Integration Test Imports" (Option A)

**Rationale:** Clearer and more accurate - legacy file is not updated in this step.

**Impact:** Step 4 title and description updated for clarity.

---

## Decision 14: Use MCP Code Checker Tools
**Date:** Plan revision discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should MCP Code Checker commands be shown in each step or centralized?

**Decision:** Remove from individual steps, add note in summary.md (KISS approach)

**Rationale:** Simpler documentation. Developers can use MCP tools as needed without cluttering step instructions.

**Impact:** Remove MCP tool commands from Steps 1-5, add usage note to summary.md.

---

## Decision 15: Import Review in Step 2
**Date:** Plan revision discussion on 2025-10-21

**Question:** Should Step 2 explicitly list all import changes needed?

**Decision:** Add note to review imports as needed (Option C)

**Rationale:** Implementation code already shows correct imports. No need for exhaustive list.

**Impact:** Add note in Step 2 about reviewing/updating imports.
