# Decisions Made During Project Plan Review

## Implementation Structure Decisions

### Step Organization
- **Decision**: Expand from 8 to 10 steps with smaller, more manageable tasks
- **Rationale**: Original Steps 3-5 were too large (4 methods + tests each), smaller steps provide faster feedback
- **Result**: Each step now has 2-3 methods maximum with immediate testing

### Testing Approach  
- **Decision**: Implementation + unit tests together in each step, with real integration tests
- **Rationale**: Tests close to implementation provide fast feedback (very important requirement)
- **Result**: Steps 3-8 each include both implementation and unit testing

### Integration Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Single evolving integration test across Steps 4, 6, 8 building full issue lifecycle  
- **Rationale**: Integration tests are VERY IMPORTANT (explicitly emphasized), single test avoids complexity
- **Result**: 
  - Step 4: create_issue → get_issue → close_issue → reopen_issue
  - Step 6: enhance with label operations (add → remove → set labels)
  - Step 8: enhance with comment operations (add → edit → delete comment)

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Decision**: Hybrid error handling approach
- **Rationale**: Need clear failure signals for auth issues while maintaining consistency with existing code
- **Result**: 
  - Raise exceptions for authentication/permission errors
  - Return empty dict/list for other errors (consistent with PullRequestManager)
  - Integration tests fail clearly with exceptions on permission issues

## Data and Scope Decisions

### Data Model Completeness
- **Decision**: Keep all planned IssueData fields (number, title, body, state, labels, user, created_at, updated_at, url, locked)
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive from start preferred over minimal MVP approach
- **Result**: Full TypedDict definitions implemented in Step 1

### Testing Coverage Level
- **Decision**: KISS approach for unit tests - essential coverage only
- **Rationale**: Focus on integration tests for validation, unit tests for basic functionality
- **Result**: Unit tests cover happy path + basic error handling + input validation only

### Implementation Priority  
- **Decision**: Full feature set in single implementation cycle
- **Rationale**: Prefer complete solution over incremental MVP approach
- **Result**: All issue operations (CRUD), label management, comment management in Steps 1-10

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### Method Grouping
- **Decision**: Logical grouping based on functionality and dependencies
- **Rationale**: get_available_labels needed as input for add_labels, reopen_issue belongs with issue lifecycle
- **Result**:
  - Step 5: get_available_labels + add_labels (input dependency)
  - Step 4: create_issue + close_issue + reopen_issue (complete lifecycle)

### Integration Test Organization
- **Decision**: Keep integration tests in same file, enhance across steps
- **Rationale**: Single evolving test is simpler than multiple test files or shared test utilities
- **Result**: One comprehensive integration test file that grows in Steps 4, 6, 8, 10
