# Project Plan Decisions

## Decisions Made During Plan Review

### 1. Integration Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Use unit tests only, no end-to-end integration tests  
**When Discussed**: When I asked about adding integration tests to verify CLI â†’ workflow parameter flow  
**Your Response**: "Just unit tests"

### 2. Performance Validation
**Decision**: No performance testing needed  
**When Discussed**: When I asked about validating performance impact of moving the function  
**Your Response**: "A" (No performance testing - function move is trivial)

### 3. Documentation Enhancement
**Decision**: No additional documentation beyond commit messages and code changes  
**When Discussed**: When I asked about adding ADR or code comments to document the architectural fix  
**Your Response**: "A" (No additional documentation)

### 4. Workflow Analysis Scope
**Decision**: Focus only on implement workflow - create_PR workflow doesn't need changes  
**When Discussed**: When you asked me to "review implementation and workflows\create_pr - both of them call commit make sure that they can call commit"  
**Analysis Result**: create_PR workflow uses `commit_all_changes()` directly with hardcoded messages, no architectural violation  
**Your Response**: "Yes," (confirming this addresses your concern)

### 5. Step Structure
**Decision**: Keep current 4-step approach for better validation  
**When Discussed**: When I asked about reducing the 4 steps to fewer steps  
**Your Response**: "A" (Keep current 4-step approach)

## Implementation Approach Confirmed
- TDD approach with comprehensive unit tests
- Incremental 4-step implementation with validation at each stage
- Focus on architectural fix without behavioral changes
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
