# Implementation Decisions

This document logs all decisions made during the project plan review discussion.

## Decision 1: Base Branch Detection
**Question**: How should the script determine which branch to compare against?  
**Decision**: Use existing `get_parent_branch_name()` function (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Leverages existing infrastructure and provides semantic naming for PR creation context.

## Decision 2: Error Recovery Strategy  
**Question**: What should happen if PR creation fails after repository cleanup?  
**Decision**: Create PR first, then cleanup only after successful PR creation (Option C)  
**Rationale**: Much safer approach - avoids data loss if PR creation fails.

## Decision 3: Step Granularity
**Question**: Should we merge Steps 1-2 to reduce complexity?  
**Decision**: Keep 5 steps as originally planned (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Each step has related unit tests, and granular steps provide better progress tracking.

## Decision 4: Configuration Options
**Question**: Should we add optional configuration flags for flexibility?  
**Decision**: Minimal approach with no extra options (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Focus on pure automation and keep implementation simple.

## Decision 5: Windows Batch File
**Question**: Should we include a Windows batch wrapper?  
**Decision**: Include batch file (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with existing `implement.bat` pattern.

## Decision 6: Safety Validations
**Question**: Should we add additional safety validations beyond git clean and incomplete tasks?  
**Decision**: Add branch validation to ensure current branch has commits different from parent branch (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Prevents creating empty PRs and provides better safety checks.

## Decision 7: User Experience Improvements
**Question**: Should we enhance user feedback beyond basic logging?  
**Decision**: Add progress indicators showing "Step 1/4: ..." style progress (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Makes the workflow more user-friendly and provides clear feedback on progress.

## Decision 8: Git Diff Exclusions
**Question**: How should we exclude planning files from the PR summary diff?  
**Decision**: Add exclusion logic to the `get_branch_diff()` function (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Keeps filtering centralized and reusable within the utility function.

## Plan Review Decisions (Post-Implementation Planning)

### Decision 9: Step Structure Complexity
**Question**: Should we merge Steps 2-3 to reduce from 5 to 4 steps?  
**Decision**: Keep 5 steps as planned (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Maintains current granular testing approach and clear separation of concerns.

### Decision 10: Path Exclusion Parameter Design
**Question**: Should `get_branch_diff()` have flexible `exclude_paths` or hardcode `pr_info/steps/*`?  
**Decision**: Keep flexible `exclude_paths` parameter (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Provides configurability without significant complexity increase.

### Decision 11: Error Recovery for Partial Success
**Question**: What happens if PR creation succeeds but cleanup fails?  
**Decision**: Log cleanup failures but don't rollback PR (Option A)  
**Rationale**: PR creation is the main goal; cleanup is housekeeping.

### Decision 12: Branch Naming Validation
**Question**: Should script validate current branch follows naming conventions?  
**Decision**: No branch naming validation (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Accept any branch name for maximum flexibility.

### Decision 13: GitHub PR Templates Integration
**Question**: Should script check for and integrate existing GitHub PR templates?  
**Decision**: Ignore PR templates - use only LLM-generated content (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Keep implementation simple and focused on automated generation.

### Decision 14: Cleanup Commit Message
**Question**: What should the commit message be for cleanup operations?  
**Decision**: "Clean up pr_info/steps planning files" (Option A + folder mention)  
**Rationale**: Clear, descriptive, and includes specific folder reference.

### Decision 15: Edge Case Handling for Parent Branch Detection
**Question**: How to handle edge cases in `get_parent_branch_name()` function?  
**Decision**: Trust existing function with graceful error handling (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Keep it simple; existing function likely handles common cases well.

### Decision 16: Dry-Run Mode
**Question**: Should script include `--dry-run` flag to preview actions?  
**Decision**: No dry-run mode (Option A)  
**Rationale**: KISS principle - maintain simplicity and direct execution.

### Decision 17: GitHub API Error Handling
**Question**: How detailed should GitHub API error handling be?  
**Decision**: Basic error handling using existing PullRequestManager patterns (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Reuse existing infrastructure and maintain consistency.

### Decision 18: User Confirmation Prompts
**Question**: Should script prompt user for confirmation before creating PR?  
**Decision**: No confirmation prompt - fully automated execution (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Maintain automation goal; prerequisite checks provide adequate safety.

## Implementation Changes Required

Based on these decisions, the following changes are needed:

1. **Step 1**: Update `get_branch_diff()` function signature to include exclusion parameter and use `get_parent_branch_name()`
2. **Step 4**: 
   - Reorder workflow to create PR before cleanup
   - Add progress indicators for user feedback
   - Include branch validation in prerequisites
   - Use path exclusions when generating diff for PR summary
   - Use commit message "Clean up pr_info/steps planning files"
3. **All Steps**: Maintain 5-step structure with comprehensive testing approach
