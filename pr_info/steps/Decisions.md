# Implementation Decisions

This document logs the decisions made during the planning review discussion.

## 1. Line Number References
**Decision**: Keep line number references in step files as-is  
**Rationale**: They are helpful for initial implementation, even if approximate  
**Discussed**: User chose Option A (keep as-is)

## 2. Module Structure - branches.py Size
**Decision**: Keep `branches.py` as one cohesive module (~250 lines)  
**Rationale**: Although larger than other modules, it remains functionally cohesive. The functions share common patterns (git branch operations) and splitting by read/write operations would not provide significant benefit  
**Discussed**: User chose Option A after discussing git command patterns

## 3. Pre-Implementation Checklist (Step 0)
**Decision**: No formal Step 0 - handle preparation informally  
**Rationale**: Pre-implementation checks (test validation, clean state, branch creation) can be done informally without a dedicated step file  
**Discussed**: User chose Option B (informal preparation)

## 4. Step 9 Validation Enhancements
**Decision**: Rely on existing test suite for validation  
**Rationale**: The existing test suite is sufficient to catch compatibility issues. No need for additional explicit backward compatibility tests, line count diffs, or signature verification  
**Discussed**: User chose Option B (existing tests sufficient)

## 5. Internal Functions in __init__.py
**Decision**: Add explicit note in Step 9 clarifying that internal functions are NOT re-exported  
**Rationale**: Improves clarity that functions like `_safe_repo_context()` are only accessible within the package via direct imports (e.g., `from .core import _safe_repo_context`)  
**Discussed**: User chose Option B (add clarification note)  
**Implementation**: Note added to Step 9 documentation

## 6. Time Estimate
**Decision**: Remove time estimate from summary.md  
**Rationale**: Time varies significantly by developer and situation; better to omit than provide potentially misleading estimate  
**Discussed**: User chose Option C (remove estimate entirely)  
**Implementation**: Changed "Estimated Effort" section to "Implementation Steps" and removed time-based estimates

## 7. Architecture Documentation Updates
**Decision**: Architecture documentation updates are optional and separate from refactoring  
**Rationale**: The refactoring is complete without documentation updates; they can be done separately if needed  
**Discussed**: User chose Option B (optional, separate)

## 8. Test Coverage Verification
**Decision**: Trust existing test suite without pre-verification  
**Rationale**: Existing tests have been passing; no need to run coverage report before starting  
**Discussed**: User chose Option B (trust existing tests)
