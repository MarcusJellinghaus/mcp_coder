# Implementation Decisions

This document logs all decisions made during the project plan review discussion.

## Decision 1: Base Branch Detection
**Question**: How should the script determine which branch to compare against?  
**Decision**: Use existing `get_parent_branch_name()` function (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Leverages existing infrastructure and provides semantic naming for PR creation context.

## Decision 2: Error Recovery Strategy  
**Question**: What should happen if PR creation fails after repository cleanup?  
**Decision**: Create PR first, then cleanup only after successful PR creation (Option C)  
**Rationale**: Much safer approach - avoids data loss if PR creation fails.

## Decision 3: Step Granularity
**Question**: Should we merge Steps 1-2 to reduce complexity?  
**Decision**: Keep 5 steps as originally planned (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Each step has related unit tests, and granular steps provide better progress tracking.

## Decision 4: Configuration Options
**Question**: Should we add optional configuration flags for flexibility?  
**Decision**: Minimal approach with no extra options (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Focus on pure automation and keep implementation simple.

## Decision 5: Windows Batch File
**Question**: Should we include a Windows batch wrapper?  
**Decision**: Include batch file (Option A)  
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with existing `implement.bat` pattern.

## Decision 6: Safety Validations
**Question**: Should we add additional safety validations beyond git clean and incomplete tasks?  
**Decision**: Add branch validation to ensure current branch has commits different from parent branch (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Prevents creating empty PRs and provides better safety checks.

## Decision 7: User Experience Improvements
**Question**: Should we enhance user feedback beyond basic logging?  
**Decision**: Add progress indicators showing "Step 1/4: ..." style progress (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Makes the workflow more user-friendly and provides clear feedback on progress.

## Decision 8: Git Diff Exclusions
**Question**: How should we exclude planning files from the PR summary diff?  
**Decision**: Add exclusion logic to the `get_branch_diff()` function (Option B)  
**Rationale**: Keeps filtering centralized and reusable within the utility function.

## Implementation Changes Required

Based on these decisions, the following changes are needed:

1. **Step 1**: Update `get_branch_diff()` function signature to include exclusion parameter and use `get_parent_branch_name()`
2. **Step 4**: 
   - Reorder workflow to create PR before cleanup
   - Add progress indicators for user feedback
   - Include branch validation in prerequisites
   - Use path exclusions when generating diff for PR summary
3. **All Steps**: Maintain 5-step structure with comprehensive testing approach
