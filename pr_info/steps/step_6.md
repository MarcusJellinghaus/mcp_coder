# Step 6: Integration Testing and Cleanup

## Objective
Complete integration, run comprehensive tests, and remove old files to finalize the CLI command conversion.

## LLM Prompt
```
Implement Step 6 from the summary (pr_info/steps/summary.md): Complete integration testing and cleanup.

Tasks:
1. Run all code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)
2. Verify `mcp-coder implement` command works end-to-end
3. Delete workflows/implement.py and workflows/implement.bat
4. Update workflow exports in __init__.py files
5. Ensure 95%+ test coverage achieved

Reference the summary document and verify all functionality is preserved from original script.
```

## Implementation Details

### WHERE
- `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/__init__.py` (update exports)
- Delete: `workflows/implement.py`, `workflows/implement.bat`
- Verify: All test files and code quality

### WHAT
**Final exports:**
```python
# workflows/implement/__init__.py
from .core import run_implement_workflow
from .prerequisites import check_prerequisites
from .task_processing import process_single_task
```

### HOW
- Run full test suite with coverage reporting
- Execute manual `mcp-coder implement --help` verification
- Clean up old files and ensure no broken references
- Verify all quality checks pass

### ALGORITHM
```
1. Update package exports for public API
2. Run comprehensive test suite (95%+ coverage target)
3. Execute end-to-end CLI verification
4. Delete old workflow files
5. Validate all code quality checks pass
```

### DATA
- Complete CLI command functionality
- All tests passing with high coverage
- Clean codebase without old files

## Files Modified/Deleted
- `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/__init__.py` (update exports)
- Delete: `workflows/implement.py`
- Delete: `workflows/implement.bat`

## Success Criteria
- `mcp-coder implement` command fully functional
- All tests pass with 95%+ coverage
- All code quality checks pass (pylint, mypy, pytest)
- Old files removed, clean integration complete
- Equivalent functionality to original script preserved
