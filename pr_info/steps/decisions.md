### Decision 1: Flexible Color Format (2025-09-29)

**Context**: The initial plan required color values to be exactly 6-character hex strings without the `#` prefix (e.g., `"FF0000"`).

**Discussion**: Most developers expect hex color APIs to accept both formats: with and without the `#` prefix (e.g., both `"FF0000"` and `"#FF0000"`). The restriction to exclude `#` adds unnecessary friction for users.

**Decision**: Accept both color formats in the API.

**Implementation**:
- The `_validate_color()` method will strip the leading `#` if present before validation
- Validation checks that the remaining string is exactly 6 hex characters
- Both `"FF0000"` and `"#FF0000"` are valid inputs
- The color is normalized (without `#`) before sending to GitHub API

**Rationale**: 
- Better developer experience - users can use whichever format they prefer
- Common pattern in color APIs
- Simple implementation - just strip `#` before validation
- GitHub API expects colors without `#`, so we normalize before API calls

**Updated Files**:
- `pr_info/steps/step_1.md` - Test data includes both formats
- `pr_info/steps/step_2.md` - Algorithm updated to strip `#` prefix
- `pr_info/steps/step_3.md` - Comment clarifies both formats work
- `pr_info/steps/step_4.md` - `create_label()` normalizes color
- `pr_info/steps/summary.md` - Design decisions updated, API documentation clarified
