fix(coordinator): handle missing branch gracefully instead of crashing

Replace ValueError with warning log and early return in dispatch_workflow()
when no linked branch is found for implement/create-pr workflows.

- Modified dispatch_workflow() in src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py
- Changed from raising ValueError to logging warning and returning early
- Updated test to verify graceful handling behavior
- Preserves all existing functionality for valid branch cases
- Coordinator now continues processing other issues instead of crashing

Resolves issue #232 where coordinator would crash on missing branches.
