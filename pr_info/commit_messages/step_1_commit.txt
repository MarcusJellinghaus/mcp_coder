refactor(coordinator): create module structure and public API exports

Create coordinator package structure as foundation for refactoring:

- Add src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator/ package directory
- Add __init__.py with complete public API exports and placeholder functions
- Add commands.py and core.py placeholder modules for future code movement
- Maintain backward compatibility through __init__.py re-exports
- Preserve all public functions, classes, and constants from original coordinator.py

Package now ready for incremental code movement in subsequent steps.
