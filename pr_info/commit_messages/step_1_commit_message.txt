Add comprehensive tests for graceful branch handling in dispatch_workflow()

Implement three test functions to verify coordinator behavior when no linked branch is found:

1. test_dispatch_workflow_handles_missing_branch_gracefully()
   - Tests that ValueError is raised when get_linked_branches() returns empty list
   - Verifies no Jenkins job is triggered and no label updates occur
   - Uses issue #156 with status-08:ready-pr label requiring branch

2. test_dispatch_workflow_continues_processing_after_skip() 
   - Placeholder in TestDispatchWorkflow class
   - Actual implementation in TestExecuteCoordinatorRun as coordinator-level test
   - Tests fail-fast behavior when dispatch_workflow raises ValueError

3. test_dispatch_workflow_preserves_existing_behavior_with_valid_branch()
   - Verifies existing functionality unchanged when branch exists
   - Tests successful dispatch with valid branch name
   - Confirms label updates and Jenkins job triggering work correctly

4. test_execute_coordinator_run_continues_processing_after_dispatch_failure()
   - Tests coordinator fail-fast behavior on dispatch failures
   - Verifies first dispatch failure stops processing of remaining issues
   - Ensures proper error logging and exit code 1

All tests follow existing patterns in the codebase and prepare for Step 2 implementation
where ValueError will be replaced with warning log and early return.
