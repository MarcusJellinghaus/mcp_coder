feat(tests): Add comprehensive tests for strip_claude_footers function

Implement Test-Driven Development for Claude footer stripping functionality:

- Add TestStripClaudeFooters class with 15 comprehensive test cases
- Cover all footer combinations: robot emoji, co-authored, and both
- Test edge cases: empty messages, None input, whitespace-only
- Test preservation of legitimate content that mentions footers
- Test case sensitivity and multiple occurrences handling
- Test complex multi-line body preservation
- Add proper test skipping mechanism when function not implemented
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions

Tests are designed to fail initially (TDD approach) and will pass
once the strip_claude_footers function is implemented in Step 2.
