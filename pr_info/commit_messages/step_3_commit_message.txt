integrate: Add cache synchronization to coordinator workflow

Integrate _update_issue_labels_in_cache() into execute_coordinator_run()
to prevent duplicate dispatches within 1-minute protection window.

Changes:
- Call cache update immediately after successful dispatch_workflow()
- Handle cache update failures gracefully (don't break main workflow)
- Add comprehensive end-to-end validation tests

Fixes cache staleness issue where GitHub label changes weren't reflected
in local cache, causing potential duplicate workflow dispatches.

The integration follows existing error handling patterns and maintains
backward compatibility with minimal code changes.
