Revert incorrect type ignore comments for requests imports

Remove `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` comments from requests imports
in CI results manager and related test files. These comments were
incorrectly added as `types-requests>=2.28.0` is already in dev
dependencies and the type ignore comments mask potential environment
setup issues.
