# Split test_issue_manager.py into Modular Test Structure

## Context

Following the completion of Issue #306 (splitting `issue_manager.py` into the `issues/` subdirectory), the test file `test_issue_manager.py` remains large at approximately **2,485 lines**.

This issue tracks the work to split this monolithic test file into a modular structure that mirrors the new production code organization.

## Motivation

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused test files are easier to navigate and maintain
- **Consistency**: Test structure should mirror the modular `issues/` production code
- **Developer Experience**: Easier to locate and run specific test suites
- **File Size Policy**: Align with project goal of keeping files under 500 lines

## Proposed Test File Structure

Split `tests/utils/github_operations/test_issue_manager.py` into:

1. **`test_issue_manager_core.py`**
   - Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete issues)
   - Core issue management functionality
   - Issue number validation

2. **`test_issue_manager_comments.py`**
   - Comment creation and retrieval
   - Comment update and deletion
   - Comment-related error handling

3. **`test_issue_manager_labels.py`**
   - Label addition and removal
   - Label listing and filtering
   - Label-related error handling

4. **`test_issue_manager_events.py`**
   - Event retrieval and parsing
   - Event filtering by type
   - Event-related functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### Principles
- **No Test Logic Changes**: This is a move-only refactoring
- **Preserve Test Coverage**: All existing tests must be preserved
- **Maintain Test Fixtures**: Shared fixtures in `conftest.py` if needed
- **Keep Test Independence**: Each test file should be independently runnable

### Steps
1. Analyze current test file to identify natural groupings
2. Create new test files with appropriate names
3. Move tests to their respective files
4. Update imports and fixtures as needed
5. Verify all tests still pass
6. Update any test documentation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All test files are under 500 lines (or reasonably close)
- [ ] All existing tests are preserved and pass
- [ ] Test files can be run independently
- [ ] No test logic changes (move only)
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns by test file
- [ ] Updated test documentation if needed
