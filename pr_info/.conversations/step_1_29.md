# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_creates_config_if_missing()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_creates_config_if_missing()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

## ✅ TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Task:** Write test `test_execute_coordinator_run_creates_config_if_missing()`

### What was implemented:

1. **Test Added** (`tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:1661-1704`):
   - New test class `TestExecuteCoordinatorRun` 
   - Test method `test_execute_coordinator_run_creates_config_if_missing()`
   - Mocks `create_default_config()` to return True
   - Verifies exit code 1 is returned
   - Verifies helpful message is printed to stdout

2. **Implementation Added** (`src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py:475-511`):
   - New function `execute_coordinator_run(args: argparse.Namespace) -> int`
   - Implements config auto-creation logic
   - Returns exit code 1 when config is created
   - Prints helpful message to user
   - Includes proper error handling structure

### Verification:

✅ **Test passes:** `test_execute_coordinator_run_creates_config_if_missing()`  
✅ **All tests pass:** 1101 tests passing (fast unit tests)  
✅ **Pylint:** No issues found  
✅ **Mypy:** No type errors found  
✅ **Task marked complete** in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Prepared Commit Message:

```
test(coordinator): add test for config auto-creation in coordinator run

Add test_execute_coordinator_run_creates_config_if_missing() to verify
that execute_coordinator_run() auto-creates config file on first run,
prints helpful message, and returns exit code 1 for user configuration.

Implement minimal execute_coordinator_run() function with config creation
logic to satisfy the test.
```

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools exclusively
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The implementation is minimal and focused - it only implements the config creation check as required by this specific test, following TDD principles. Additional functionality will be added in subsequent tests.
