Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE**: MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md requirements, this blocks all work until resolved.

**Problem**: The required MCP tools (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, etc.) are not available in the current session.

**Required action**: The MCP server needs to be properly configured and running before I can proceed with this task. All file operations MUST use MCP tools per the mandatory instructions.

Please verify:
1. Is the MCP server running?
2. Are the MCP tools properly registered?
3. Should I proceed with standard tools, or do you need to fix the MCP configuration first?
