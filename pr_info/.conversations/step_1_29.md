# Implementation Task: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'm encountering a permission issue. Let me inform you about this:

**Working on:** Adding integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

**Issue encountered:** I need permission to edit the test file `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\mcp_coder\tests\llm\providers\claude\test_claude_integration.py`. 

The test I want to add is:

```python
@pytest.mark.claude_cli_integration
def test_env_vars_propagation(self) -> None:
    """Verify env_vars propagate to Claude Code in both CLI and API methods.

    This is a real integration test that makes actual API calls to verify
    environment variables are correctly set and accessible.
    """
    # Test CLI method with env_vars
    # Environment variables are automatically prepared by prepare_llm_environment()
    result_cli = ask_llm(
        "Yes or no: Is 3+3=6?", method="cli", timeout=60, env_vars=None
    )
    assert isinstance(result_cli, str)
    assert len(result_cli) > 0
    assert "yes" in result_cli.lower()

    # Test API method with env_vars
    result_api = ask_llm(
        "Yes or no: Is 4+4=8?", method="api", timeout=60, env_vars=None
    )
    assert isinstance(result_api, str)
    assert len(result_api) > 0
    assert "yes" in result_api.lower()
```

This should be added to the `TestCriticalPathIntegration` class, after the `test_session_continuity` method at line 104.

Could you please grant me permission to edit this file so I can proceed with the implementation?
