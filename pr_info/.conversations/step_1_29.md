# Implementation Task: Add DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND constant to coordinator.py with comprehensive test script (see step_8.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND constant to coordinator.py with comprehensive test script (see step_8.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I can see that all tasks for Step 8 are now marked as complete with `[x]`. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Step 8 Implementation Complete ✅

I have successfully completed **Step 8: Implement DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND Constant** with all requirements met:

### What Was Done:

1. ✅ **DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND constant added** - A comprehensive multi-line shell script in `coordinator.py` that verifies:
   - Tool verification (mcp-coder, mcp-code-checker, mcp-server-filesystem)
   - Environment setup (PROJECT_DIR, VENV_DIR, dependency sync)
   - Claude CLI verification (installation, MCP server list, basic functionality)
   - MCP Coder functionality testing
   - Virtual environment activation and re-verification

2. ✅ **execute_coordinator_test() updated** - Now uses `DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND` instead of hardcoded `"mcp-coder --version"`

3. ✅ **Test added** - `test_execute_coordinator_test_uses_default_test_command` verifies the constant is properly used

4. ✅ **Documentation added** - New "Test Command" section in `CONFIG.md` explains:
   - What gets tested (5 categories)
   - Full test script listing
   - Customization note about future enhancements

5. ✅ **All code quality checks passed**:
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Pytest: 1061 tests passed (excluding slow integration tests)
   - Mypy: No type errors

### Prepared Commit Message:

```
feat(step-8): use DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND for comprehensive environment tests

Add DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND constant containing multi-line shell script that
verifies complete environment setup (tools, dependencies, Claude CLI, MCP
Coder functionality). Update execute_coordinator_test() to use this constant
instead of hardcoded "mcp-coder --version". Add test to verify DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND
usage. Document test command in CONFIG.md with detailed explanation of what
gets tested and full script listing.
```

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py` - Added constant and updated usage
- ✅ `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py` - Added comprehensive test
- ✅ `docs/configuration/CONFIG.md` - Added "Test Command" documentation section
- ✅ `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` - All Step 8 tasks marked complete

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively, all code quality checks passed, no issues remaining.

The implementation is complete and ready for the next step (Step 9: Clean Up Test Imports).
