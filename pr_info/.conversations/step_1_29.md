# Implementation Task: Review README.md for accuracy (check venv requirements, setup instructions)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Review README.md for accuracy (check venv requirements, setup instructions)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md file.

## ✅ TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Task:** Review README.md for accuracy (check venv requirements, setup instructions)

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Done:

1. **README.md Review** ✅
   - Thoroughly reviewed for virtual environment requirements - NONE FOUND
   - Checked setup instructions - Simple and accurate as-is
   - Verified no platform-specific venv warnings exist
   - **Result:** No changes needed - documentation is accurate

2. **Additional Documentation Checks** ✅
   - Confirmed no INSTALL.md, SETUP.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, or TROUBLESHOOTING.md files exist
   - Verified .mcp.json configuration is correct (uses `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` properly)
   - Reviewed ARCHITECTURE.md - No venv requirement claims found
   - **Result:** All documentation accurate and correct

3. **Code Quality Checks** ✅
   - Pytest: 982 tests passed
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Mypy: No type errors found

4. **Task Tracker Updated** ✅
   - Marked task as complete in pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md

### Key Finding:
The environment detection changes are **internal implementation details** that don't affect user-facing documentation. All documentation correctly focuses on high-level features and simple setup without making claims about virtual environment requirements or detection mechanisms.

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
docs: verify README.md accuracy for Step 4

Reviewed README.md for virtual environment requirements and setup 
instructions. Confirmed documentation is accurate and requires no 
changes - the environment detection simplification is an internal 
implementation detail that doesn't affect user-facing documentation.

Also verified .mcp.json and ARCHITECTURE.md are correct.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
