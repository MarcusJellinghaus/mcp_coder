# Implementation Task: Step 6: Run Tests and Verify Implementation (step_6.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 6: Run Tests and Verify Implementation (step_6.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement Step 6: Run Tests and Verify Implementation. Let me first examine the task tracker and step details.Now let me start implementing Step 6 by creating a todo list and running the tests to verify the implementation.I'm working on **Step 6: Run Tests and Verify Implementation**. This step involves running comprehensive test verification to ensure the refactoring works correctly.Let me first check the current test file to understand what tests we need to run:Now let me run the comprehensive test suite to verify the implementation. I'll start by running the specific new tests to verify they pass:Great! The new save function tests pass. Now let me run all the tests in the prompt test file to ensure no regressions:Excellent! All tests pass with only 2 skipped tests (which are expected - the tests for prompt_claude function that will be implemented later). Now let me run the full test suite to ensure no other regressions:Great! All unit tests pass. Now let me run the code quality checks:Perfect! All code quality checks pass. Now let me prepare the commit message and mark the step as complete:Now let me update the task tracker to mark Step 6 as complete:## Summary

**Step 6: Run Tests and Verify Implementation** has been successfully completed.

### What was accomplished:

1. **Comprehensive Test Verification**: Ran all tests to verify the refactoring implementation works correctly
   - 4 new test methods for parameter mapping and save functions passed
   - All 28 existing tests in `test_prompt.py` continued to pass (no regressions)
   - Full unit test suite (469 tests) passed successfully

2. **Code Quality Checks**: All quality checks passed without issues
   - **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found
   - **Pytest**: 469 unit tests passed, 2 expected skips
   - **Mypy**: No type errors found

3. **Implementation Verification**: Confirmed that all refactoring components work as expected
   - Save conversation functions are implemented and tested
   - Parameter mapping structure is verified and ready for Step 3 integration
   - No breaking changes to existing CLI functionality

### Test Results:
- ✅ **New Tests**: 4/4 new test methods pass
- ✅ **Existing Tests**: 28/28 existing tests continue to pass (no regressions)
- ✅ **Full Test Suite**: 469 unit tests pass
- ✅ **Code Quality**: All pylint, pytest, and mypy checks pass

The refactoring implementation is fully verified and ready. The step has been marked as complete in `TASK_TRACKER.md`.

**Suggested commit message**: `test(step6): verify execute_prompt refactoring implementation`
