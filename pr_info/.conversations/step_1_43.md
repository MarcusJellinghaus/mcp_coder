# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 0: SHOW CONFIGURATION TASK**
- Please check which MCP servers you have. What can you use them for? Which tools are you allowed to use. Please list them.
  Do you have full acces to the MCP servers / tools?
  
**STEP 1: ANALYSE .mcp.json**  
- Please check the `.mcp.json`. It contains some variables. Do you have all of them available as environment variables?
  Can you spot any issue?

**STEP 2: Check for issues**
- Please let me know whether you can use the MCP file system tools, and/or whether there is any issue. 
  If there is an issue, please investigate and report to me 
  
**Step 3: Show environment variables**  
- Please check whether these environment variables are available to you, and print them (if possible):
  - MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR
  - MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR
  - VIRTUAL_ENV
  
Pleae ignore the next few lines. They were put by technical mistake.  

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## üìä INVESTIGATION SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
1. **MCP Servers:** Both `code-checker` and `filesystem` MCP servers are accessible
2. **MCP Tools:** All required tools are available with full access
3. **Filesystem Operations:** MCP filesystem tools work correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Identified:**

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Environment variables are **NOT** available in my Bash environment:
- ‚ùå `MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR` - Not set
- ‚ùå `MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR` - Not set  
- ‚ùå `VIRTUAL_ENV` - Not set

**However:** The MCP servers themselves ARE working, which means:
- The environment variables ARE available to the MCP server processes
- They were likely set when Claude Code launched the MCP servers
- They are NOT propagated to my Bash shell sessions

### üîç **Root Cause:**
The `.mcp.json` configuration uses environment variable substitution (`${VARIABLE_NAME}`), which is handled by Claude Code when **launching the MCP servers**. These variables don't need to be available in my Bash environment - they only need to be available when Claude Code starts the MCP servers.

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**
**Everything is working correctly!** The MCP tools are functional, which proves the environment variables were properly configured when the MCP servers were launched. The fact that I can't see them in Bash is expected and not a problem.

**Ready to proceed with implementing the task. Should I continue with the task from TASK_TRACKER.md?**
