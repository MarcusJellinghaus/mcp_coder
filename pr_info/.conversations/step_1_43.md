# Implementation Task: Perform manual integration testing with real GitHub API

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Perform manual integration testing with real GitHub API

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need user approval to run the batch file commands. Let me explain what I'm doing:

I'm performing manual integration testing of the `validate_labels.py` script with the real GitHub API. This involves running several test commands to verify:

1. **Test 1: Help Flag** - Verify `--help` displays usage information
2. **Test 2: Dry-Run Mode** - Verify `--dry-run` analyzes without making changes
3. **Test 3: Debug Logging** - Verify detailed logging works
4. **Test 4: Combined Flags** - Verify multiple flags work together
5. **Test 5: Exit Codes** - Verify proper exit codes (0, 1, 2)

All tests will use the batch file `workflows\validate_labels.bat` which is a wrapper around the Python script.

**Should I proceed with running these test commands?** They will interact with the real GitHub API (read-only for dry-run, potentially write for normal mode).
