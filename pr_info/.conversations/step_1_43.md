# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The error is:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'
```

This means **the package needs to be reinstalled** to pick up the new `create_pr` subpackage we created in earlier steps. This is exactly what the task tracker warned about with "(requires package reinstall)".

The issue is that I need user approval to run `pip install -e .`. Let me inform the user about this blocker:

**BLOCKER FOUND: Package Reinstall Required**

The tests are failing because the `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr` module isn't available in the installed package. This is because:

1. In earlier steps (Step 2), we created a new package structure: `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`
2. The package was installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`) at that time
3. However, the current Python environment doesn't have the updated package structure

**Solution needed:**  
Run the following command to reinstall the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Why this is required:**  
When we create new Python packages/modules in an editable install, we need to reinstall to update the package metadata and make the new modules importable.

**Test results show:**  
- ❌ 5 test files in `tests/workflows/create_pr/` can't be imported (ModuleNotFoundError)
- ❌ Integration tests in `tests/workflows/test_create_pr_integration.py` also failing with same error
- ✅ Test files exist and are properly structured
- ✅ Import statements are correct

I need your approval to run `pip install -e .` to reinstall the package and proceed with the comprehensive testing.

Should I proceed with the package reinstall?
