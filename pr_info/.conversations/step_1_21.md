# Implementation Task: Create source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` with JobStatus and QueueSummary dataclasses

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` with JobStatus and QueueSummary dataclasses

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been marked as complete. Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Task Complete: Create models.py with JobStatus and QueueSummary

**Implementation Summary:**

I successfully created the source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` with two dataclasses:

### 1. JobStatus Dataclass
- **Fields:** `status`, `build_number`, `duration_ms`, `url`
- **Purpose:** Represents Jenkins job execution status
- **Features:** Custom `__str__()` method for human-readable output
  - Queued jobs: "Job queued"
  - Running jobs: "Job #42: running"
  - Completed jobs: "Job #42: SUCCESS (1234ms)"

### 2. QueueSummary Dataclass
- **Fields:** `running`, `queued`
- **Purpose:** Holds Jenkins queue statistics
- **Features:** Custom `__str__()` method with proper pluralization
  - Example: "3 jobs running, 2 jobs queued"

### Code Quality Results:
- ✅ **Pytest:** All 12 tests pass (test_models.py:test_models.py:79)
- ✅ **Mypy:** No type errors found
- ✅ **Pylint:** No issues found

### Files Created:
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` (~120 lines with comprehensive docstrings)

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The implementation follows TDD principles - tests were already created in a previous step, and the models were implemented to make all tests pass.
