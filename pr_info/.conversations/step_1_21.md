Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **MCP Server Issue Detected**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md, this blocks all work until resolved. The following MCP tools are required but unavailable:
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__read_reference_file`
- Other filesystem operations

**This must be resolved before I can proceed with the task.**

However, I notice that the standard `Read` tool is available. Would you like me to:
1. Wait for MCP server to be fixed (per CLAUDE.md strict requirements)
2. Proceed with standard tools for now (violates CLAUDE.md but allows progress)

Please advise how you'd like to proceed.
