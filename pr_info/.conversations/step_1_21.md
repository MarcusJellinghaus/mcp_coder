# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Based on the test failure details, the issue is clear: **the MCP code-checker is running pytest against the production venv installation at `local-windows/mcp_coder_prod/.venv`, but that installation is outdated and doesn't have the latest code from the `targets/mcp_coder` directory.**

The problem is:
1. We've made code changes in `targets/mcp_coder/`
2. The MCP code-checker runs pytest using the venv at `mcp_coder_prod/.venv`
3. That venv has an old pip installation that doesn't include our new code

The solution is to reinstall the package in editable mode. Let me create a summary of what needs to be done and ask the user for help:

**Summary of Test Failures:**

The pytest failures indicate that the production venv (`local-windows/mcp_coder_prod/.venv`) has an outdated installation of the `mcp_coder` package. The tests are trying to import:
- `mcp_coder.utils.user_config.create_default_config` - This function exists in our code
- `mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator` - This module exists in our code
- The coordinator command in the parser - This has been added to main.py

All of these exist in the `targets/mcp_coder` directory, but the venv is using an older installed version.

**The fix requires reinstalling the package in editable mode:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ..\targets\mcp_coder
```

However, I cannot execute this command as it requires approval. 

**Would you like me to:**
1. Wait for you to run this reinstall command manually, then I'll re-run the tests?
2. Proceed with documenting what I found and marking the task with this known issue?

Please run the reinstall command above, and then I can continue with the verification.
