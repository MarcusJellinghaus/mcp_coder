Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE: MCP tools are not accessible**

The MCP filesystem tools that are mandatory according to CLAUDE.md are not available. This blocks all work until resolved.

**Expected tool:** `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
**Error:** "No such tool available"

The project instructions require exclusive use of MCP tools for file operations, but they are not currently accessible. I cannot proceed with the task until the MCP server is properly configured and running.

**Please verify:**
1. Is the MCP server running?
2. Are the MCP tools properly configured in your Claude Code settings?
3. Can you check the MCP server logs for any errors?

I cannot use the standard `Read`, `Write`, or `Edit` tools as per the mandatory instructions in CLAUDE.md.
