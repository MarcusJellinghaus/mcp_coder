# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! There's a reinstall script. However, I realize this might disrupt the AutoRunner workflow. Let me think about this differently.

Looking at the error message more carefully, the issue is that pip installed mcp-coder from `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\mcp_coder_prod` but we're working in `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder`. 

**I need to inform the user about this situation and get their approval to reinstall the package so that the tests can find the new module.**

Let me provide a clear summary of what needs to happen:

---

**STATUS UPDATE:**

I've successfully created all the required files for Step 1:

✅ **Files Created:**
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/__init__.py`
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` (with JobStatus and QueueSummary dataclasses)
- `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/__init__.py`
- `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` (with 11 comprehensive tests)

✅ **Code Quality:**
- Models follow TDD principles (tests written first)
- Full type hints with Optional types
- Human-readable __str__() methods with proper pluralization
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Follows existing patterns from git_operations/core.py

**⚠️ BLOCKING ISSUE:**

The tests cannot run because the mcp-coder package is currently installed from a different directory:
- **Installed from:** `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\mcp_coder_prod`
- **Working in:** `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder` (current directory)

**SOLUTION NEEDED:**

To proceed with testing, I need to reinstall the mcp-coder package from the current directory. I can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or using the provided batch script:
```bash
tools\reinstall.bat
```

**May I have your approval to run the reinstall command?** This will install mcp-coder in editable mode from the current directory, allowing pytest to import the new `jenkins_operations` module.
