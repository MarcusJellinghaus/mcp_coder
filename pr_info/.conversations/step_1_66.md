# Implementation Task: Create `tests/cli/commands/conftest.py` with `mock_labels_config` fixture

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

✅ **Included all requirements:**
- 6 workflow labels (status-02, 03, 05, 06, 08, 09)
- Each with `name`, `category`, and `internal_id` fields
- `ignore_labels` list with `["Overview"]`
- Comprehensive docstring explaining purpose and usage

### Code Quality Verification:
✅ **Pylint:** No issues found  
✅ **Pytest:** All 1121 fast unit tests passed  
✅ **Mypy:** No type errors found  

### Task Tracker Updated:
✅ Marked task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
feat(tests): add mock_labels_config fixture to reduce test duplication

Create shared pytest fixture in tests/cli/commands/conftest.py providing
standard mock labels configuration. This reduces code duplication across
coordinator tests by centralizing the mock label config structure.

Includes all 6 workflow labels and ignore_labels list matching the
structure from config/labels.json.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
