# Implementation Task: Part C: Validate and Run Quality Checks

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part C: Validate and Run Quality Checks

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## ✅ Task Complete: Step 2, Part C - Validate and Run Quality Checks

**Summary of completed work:**

1. **✅ All create_pr workflow tests passed** (9 tests)
   - Ran with parallel execution (`-n auto`)
   - Excluded slow integration tests
   - All tests pass successfully

2. **✅ Pylint check passed**
   - Target: `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`
   - No issues found

3. **✅ Mypy check passed**
   - Target: `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`
   - No type errors found

4. **✅ Git commit message prepared:**
   ```
   refactor(create-pr): validate Step 2 workflow package migration

   - All create_pr workflow tests pass (9 tests)
   - Pylint check passes on workflow package
   - Mypy check passes with no type errors
   - Step 2 migration validated and complete
   ```

5. **✅ TASK_TRACKER.md updated**
   - Part C marked as complete with all sub-tasks checked

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools exclusively
- ✅ All three code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
- ✅ No standard Claude tools used when MCP alternatives existed

**Step 2 is now fully complete!** The workflow package has been successfully created, migrated, and validated with all tests and quality checks passing.
