## LLM Response:
Perfect! Step 8 is now complete. Let me provide the commit message:

## ✅ Step 8 Complete

**Implementation Summary:**

1. ✅ Updated `src/mcp_coder/__init__.py` to export new functions:
   - `prompt_llm`, `serialize_llm_response`, `deserialize_llm_response`
   - `LLMResponseDict`, `LLM_RESPONSE_VERSION`

2. ✅ Verified all submodule `__all__` exports (all were already correct):
   - `llm_types.py`: 2 exports
   - `llm_serialization.py`: 4 exports  
   - `llm_interface.py`: 4 exports

3. ✅ Created `tests/test_module_exports.py` with 10 comprehensive import tests

4. ✅ All code quality checks passed:
   - Pytest: 10/10 tests passed
   - Pylint: No issues
   - Mypy: No type errors

**Commit Message:**

```
feat(llm): export session management functions and types (Step 8)

Update module exports to make new session management functions easily 
discoverable for users.

Changes:
- Export prompt_llm, serialize/deserialize functions from __init__.py
- Export LLMResponseDict and LLM_RESPONSE_VERSION types
- Add comprehensive import tests (10 test cases)

Users can now import with:
  from mcp_coder import prompt_llm, LLMResponseDict
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
