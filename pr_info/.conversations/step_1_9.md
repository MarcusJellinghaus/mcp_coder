## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement create_pull_request with actual GitHub API calls

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll examine the task tracker to understand the current task and implement it step by step.Now let me check the tests readme to understand which tests to run:Now let me examine the current PullRequestManager implementation to see what needs to be done for the `create_pull_request` method:Now let me check the test file to understand what the expected behavior should be:I'll implement the `create_pull_request` method with actual GitHub API calls. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this specific task.Now let me implement the `create_pull_request` method with actual GitHub API calls:I notice there was a duplicate in the edit. Let me fix that by reading the file and doing a proper edit:I can see there's a duplication issue in the file. Let me fix this by replacing the entire problematic method with the correct implementation:Good! Now let me mark the current task as completed and run the code quality checks:Now let me run the code quality checks as required:Great! All code quality checks pass. Let me verify the implementation by reading the final version of the file to ensure it's correct:Perfect! I have successfully implemented the `create_pull_request` method with actual GitHub API calls. Let me now check the task tracker to confirm the task is complete and update it accordingly:Now I need to mark the task as completed in the task tracker:Perfect! I have successfully completed the task "Implement create_pull_request with actual GitHub API calls". Let me clean up the todo list since the task is now complete:## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `create_pull_request` method with actual GitHub API calls. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Details
- **Method**: `create_pull_request` in `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/pr_manager.py:77`
- **Functionality**: Creates a pull request using the GitHub API via PyGithub
- **Return Format**: Structured dictionary with comprehensive PR information including:
  - `number`, `title`, `body`, `state`
  - `head_branch`, `base_branch`, `url`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`, `user`
  - `mergeable`, `merged`, `draft`
- **Error Handling**: Catches `GithubException` and general exceptions, returns empty dict on failure
- **Logging**: Uses `@log_function_call` decorator for debugging

### Quality Assurance
✅ **Pylint**: No issues found  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors  
✅ **Pytest**: All 409 unit tests pass  

### Task Status
- Marked as completed in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Ready for the next implementation step in Step 4

**Suggested commit message**: `feat(github): implement create_pull_request with actual GitHub API calls`

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and provides robust error handling while maintaining the expected interface for the integration tests.
