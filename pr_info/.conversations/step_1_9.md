Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I don't see a task about "core.py with utilities and type definitions" in the current task tracker. The task tracker shows all 8 steps related to environment variable propagation have been implemented, though some are missing commit messages.

Could you please clarify:
1. Are you referring to a different task tracker or project plan?
2. Or should I work on one of the incomplete items (preparing commit messages for steps 4, 5, 6, and 8)?
3. Or is there a new feature/task that needs to be added to the tracker?

Please let me know which task you'd like me to focus on.
