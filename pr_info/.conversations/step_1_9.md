   - `delete_comment(issue_number, comment_id)`: Deletes a comment from an issue

2. **Unit tests added** (tests/utils/test_issue_manager.py):
   - `test_edit_comment_success`: Verifies successful comment editing
   - `test_edit_comment_empty_body`: Tests empty body validation
   - `test_edit_comment_invalid_issue_number`: Tests invalid issue number handling
   - `test_edit_comment_invalid_comment_id`: Tests invalid comment ID handling
   - `test_edit_comment_auth_error_raises`: Tests authentication error handling
   - `test_delete_comment_success`: Verifies successful comment deletion
   - `test_delete_comment_invalid_issue_number`: Tests invalid issue number handling
   - `test_delete_comment_invalid_comment_id`: Tests invalid comment ID handling
   - `test_delete_comment_auth_error_raises`: Tests authentication error handling

3. **Integration test added** (tests/utils/test_issue_manager_integration.py):
