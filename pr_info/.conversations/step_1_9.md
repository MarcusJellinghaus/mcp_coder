# Implementation Task: Run mypy - fix all issues found

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Run mypy - fix all issues found

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ The task tracker has been successfully updated. I can confirm:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Run mypy - fix all issues found (Step 1)

### What was accomplished:

1. ✅ **Ran mypy type checking** using `mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check`
   - Result: **No type errors found** - all type checking passes

2. ✅ **Verified other quality checks**:
   - Pylint: All checks pass
   - Pytest: Tests fail as expected (TDD RED phase)

3. ✅ **Prepared commit message**:
   ```
   test: verify mypy passes for TDD red phase

   All type checking passes for the new test implementations that define
   expected behavior for runner environment detection via environment variables.
   Tests fail as expected in TDD red phase - implementation will follow in Step 2.
   ```

4. ✅ **Updated TASK_TRACKER.md**:
   - Marked "Run mypy - fix all issues found" as complete [x]
   - Marked "Prepare git commit message for Step 1" as complete [x]

### Status:
**All Step 1 tasks are now complete!** The TDD RED phase is finished with:
- All new tests implemented and failing (as expected)
- All code quality checks passing (pylint, mypy)
- Ready to proceed to Step 2 (TDD GREEN phase)

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively (`mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check`, `mcp__filesystem__*`)
- ✅ All code quality checks completed
- ✅ Task tracker updated correctly
