## LLM Response:
## Task Completed âœ“

**Working on:** Add shebang and module docstring to workflows/define_labels.py

**Status:** The task is already complete. The file `workflows/define_labels.py` already contains:

1. **Shebang** (line 1): `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
2. **Module docstring** (lines 2-7): Comprehensive description of the module's purpose

Both elements were implemented in previous steps. I've marked this task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`.

**Commit message:**
```
docs(workflows): mark shebang and module docstring task as complete

The shebang and module docstring were already added to 
workflows/define_labels.py in previous implementation steps.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
