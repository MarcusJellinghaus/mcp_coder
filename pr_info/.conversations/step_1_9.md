# Implementation Task: Add LabelLookups TypedDict at module level

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add LabelLookups TypedDict at module level

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me prepare the commit message as required in **STEP 5**:

## Summary

**Task Completed:** Add LabelLookups TypedDict at module level

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `LabelLookups` TypedDict class to `workflows/validate_labels.py` at module level (after logger setup, before STALE_TIMEOUTS constant)
- Added `TypedDict` to imports from typing module
- TypedDict includes four lookup structures as specified:
  - `id_to_name`: Maps internal_id to label_name
  - `all_names`: Set of all workflow label names
  - `name_to_category`: Maps label_name to category
  - `name_to_id`: Maps label_name to internal_id
- Location: workflows/validate_labels.py:25-31

**Verification:**
- ✅ Pylint check passed (no issues)
- ✅ Mypy check passed (no type errors)
- ✅ Pytest check passed (all 6 validate_labels tests passed)
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Commit Message:**
```
feat(validate-labels): add LabelLookups TypedDict for step 3.1

Add LabelLookups TypedDict at module level in validate_labels.py
to define structure for label lookup data structures including
id_to_name, all_names, name_to_category, and name_to_id mappings.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively (mcp__filesystem__edit_file, mcp__code-checker__)
- ✅ All code quality checks passed using MCP tools
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
