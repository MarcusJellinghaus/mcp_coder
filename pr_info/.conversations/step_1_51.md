# Implementation Task: Implement remotes.py with remote operations

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement remotes.py with remote operations

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

✅ **Step 8 Complete: Implement remotes.py with remote operations**

**Implementation completed:**
- Created `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations/remotes.py` (~260 lines)
- Extracted 5 functions from original `git_operations.py`:
  - `git_push()` - Push current branch to origin
  - `push_branch()` - Push specific branch with optional upstream tracking
  - `fetch_remote()` - Fetch from remote repository
  - `get_github_repository_url()` - Get GitHub URL from remote origin
  - `_parse_github_url()` - Parse and convert git URLs to GitHub HTTPS format

**Code quality checks - all passed:**
- ✅ Pylint check: No issues found
- ✅ Pytest check: 1 test passed (git_push_basic_workflow)
- ✅ Mypy check: No type errors

**Commit message prepared:**
```
Implement remotes.py with remote operations

- Created src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations/remotes.py
- Extracted git_push(), push_branch(), fetch_remote() functions
- Extracted get_github_repository_url() and _parse_github_url() helpers
- All functions use _safe_repo_context from core module
- Imports from .core, .repository, and .branches modules
- All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks
- All three code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
