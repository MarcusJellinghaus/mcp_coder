# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_priority_ordering()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_end_to_end_priority_ordering()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

✅ **Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_priority_ordering()`**

### What Was Implemented

I successfully added the `test_end_to_end_priority_ordering()` integration test to `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`. This test validates that the coordinator properly processes issues in priority order (status-08 → status-05 → status-02) regardless of the order in which they are returned by the issue manager.

### Test Details

The test:
- **Mocks 3 issues** returned in random order: status-02, status-08, status-05
- **Verifies processing order**: Issues are dispatched in priority order: 08 → 05 → 02
- **Validates workflow calls**: Confirms Jenkins jobs are triggered in correct sequence
- **Checks label transitions**: Ensures labels are updated in priority order

### Code Quality Checks

All code quality checks passed:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 3 integration tests pass (including the new one)

### Commit Message Prepared

```
test(coordinator): add priority ordering integration test

Add test_end_to_end_priority_ordering() to verify that issues are
processed in correct priority order (status-08 → 05 → 02) regardless
of the order returned by the issue manager.

Test validates:
- Issues returned in random order (02, 08, 05)
- Processed in priority order: 08 → 05 → 02
- dispatch_workflow calls in correct sequence
- All label transitions occur in priority order
```

### Task Tracker Updated

✅ Marked `test_end_to_end_priority_ordering()` as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP filesystem and code-checker tools exclusively throughout the implementation.
