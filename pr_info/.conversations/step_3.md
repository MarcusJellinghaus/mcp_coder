# Implementation Task: Step 3 implementation: Create integration tests for --mcp-config CLI argument

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 3 implementation: Create integration tests for --mcp-config CLI argument

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully completed **Step 3: Create integration tests for --mcp-config CLI argument**. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Implementation Complete

**File Created:**
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_config_integration.py` - Comprehensive integration tests

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ `test_implement_with_mcp_config_argument()` - Tests most complex command (implement)
2. ✅ `test_prompt_with_mcp_config_argument()` - Tests simplest command (prompt)
3. ✅ `test_mcp_config_not_required()` - Tests backward compatibility (PASSES)
4. ✅ `test_mcp_config_with_relative_path()` - Tests relative path support
5. ✅ CLI parser tests for all commands (implement, prompt, create-plan, create-pr, commit auto)
6. ✅ `test_mcp_config_is_optional()` - Tests backward compatibility at parser level (PASSES)

### ✅ Code Quality - All Checks Pass

- **Pylint**: ✅ No issues found
- **Mypy**: ✅ No type errors (fixed return type annotation)
- **Pytest**: 
  - ✅ All existing tests pass (1126 tests)
  - ⚠️ New integration tests: 8 fail as expected (TDD), 2 pass (backward compatibility)

### 📋 Expected Test Behavior (TDD)

As documented in step_3.md:
> **Expected Result:** All tests FAIL because CLI parsers don't yet have `--mcp-config` argument and commands don't accept the parameter. This is correct TDD behavior - integration tests define expected behavior before implementation.

The tests correctly fail with:
- `SystemExit: 2` - Parser doesn't recognize `--mcp-config` argument
- `AssertionError` - Command doesn't include MCP config flags

The backward compatibility tests correctly PASS, ensuring existing functionality is preserved.

### 💾 Commit Message Prepared

```
test(step 3): add integration tests for --mcp-config CLI argument

Add comprehensive integration tests to verify end-to-end flow of --mcp-config argument from CLI parsing through to LLM provider invocation.

Tests follow TDD approach - written BEFORE CLI implementation in Step 4.
Expected behavior: Most tests FAIL until Step 4 implements the CLI argument.

Test Coverage:
- implement command with mcp_config parameter
- prompt command with mcp_config parameter  
- Backward compatibility (commands work without --mcp-config)
- Relative path support for config files
- CLI parser acceptance of --mcp-config argument

Quality checks: All pass (pylint, mypy)
Existing tests: All pass (1126 tests)
New integration tests: 8 fail as expected (TDD), 2 pass (backward compatibility)
```

### ✅ Task Tracker Updated

All three sub-tasks marked complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`:
- [x] Step 3 implementation
- [x] Step 3 quality checks
- [x] Step 3 commit preparation

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Verified task completion against requirements
