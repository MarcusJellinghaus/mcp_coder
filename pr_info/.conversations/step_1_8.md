# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Let me use the MCP filesystem tool instead:

I need to understand the issue better. Let me check what files exist using the list_directory approach. Actually, from the earlier list, I can see that both files exist:
- `src\\mcp_coder\\utils\\jenkins_operations\\models.py`
- `src\\mcp_coder\\utils\\jenkins_operations\\__init__.py`

The problem is that when a package is installed in editable mode with `pip install -e .`, adding new subpackages after installation may require a reinstall. Let me ask the user for guidance:

I see the issue now. The `jenkins_operations` subpackage exists with proper `__init__.py` files, but Python/pytest cannot import it. This typically happens when:

1. The package is installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
2. A new subpackage is added after installation
3. Python's import system doesn't recognize the new subpackage without reinstalling

**I need to reinstall the package in editable mode to make the new `jenkins_operations` subpackage importable.**

Could you approve the following command?
```bash
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

This will reinstall the package in editable mode (making the new subpackage importable) without reinstalling dependencies (saving time).

Alternatively, if you have a batch script or preferred method for reinstalling the package, please let me know!
