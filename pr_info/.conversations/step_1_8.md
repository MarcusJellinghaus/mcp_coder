# Implementation Task: Create `tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py` (step_4.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py` (step_4.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
This is very strange. The test class is named `TestExecuteCreatePlan` and pytest should find it.  Let me try one last thing - maybe the MCP code-checker tool has a bug or limitation. Let me ask the user for approval to run pytest directly:

I need to ask the user for help. The test file has been created successfully, passes pylint and mypy checks, but pytest is not discovering the tests. This might be an issue with the MCP code-checker configuration or a bug in the tool. Let me provide a status update to the user:

I've successfully created the test file `tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py` with 4 comprehensive tests covering:
1. Successful command execution
2. Workflow failure handling  
3. Exception handling
4. Keyboard interrupt handling

However, I'm encountering an issue where pytest is not discovering the tests when run through the MCP code-checker tool. The file:
- ✅ Exists at the correct location
- ✅ Passes pylint check (no errors)
- ✅ Passes mypy check (no type errors)
- ✅ Has the correct naming pattern (`test_*.py`)
- ✅ Has proper test class and method names

The issue appears to be specific to pytest test discovery through the MCP tool. Can you please approve running pytest directly so I can verify the tests work correctly?

```bash
python -m pytest tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py -v
```

This will help me confirm whether the tests are functional and the issue is just with the MCP tool's test discovery mechanism.
