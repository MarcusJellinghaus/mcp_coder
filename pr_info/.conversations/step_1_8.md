## Summary

I have successfully implemented **4 tests for argument parsing and validation** for the `define_labels` workflow:

### Tests Added:

**TestArgumentParsing class (4 tests):**
1. `test_parse_arguments_default_values` - Verifies default values (project_dir=None, log_level="INFO", dry_run=False)
2. `test_parse_arguments_custom_values` - Verifies custom arguments are parsed correctly
3. `test_parse_arguments_log_level_choices` - Verifies all valid log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
4. `test_parse_arguments_invalid_log_level` - Verifies invalid log level causes SystemExit with code 2

**TestResolveProjectDir class (6 tests):**
1. `test_resolve_project_dir_current_directory` - Verifies None argument uses current directory
2. `test_resolve_project_dir_explicit_path` - Verifies explicit path resolution
3. `test_resolve_project_dir_nonexistent_directory` - Verifies failure for nonexistent paths
4. `test_resolve_project_dir_not_git_repository` - Verifies failure for non-git directories
5. `test_resolve_project_dir_file_instead_of_directory` - Verifies failure when path is a file
6. `test_resolve_project_dir_relative_path` - Verifies absolute path conversion

### Test Results:
- ✅ All 10 new tests passing (4 argument parsing + 6 validation)
- ✅ All 36 unit tests in test_define_labels.py passing
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
