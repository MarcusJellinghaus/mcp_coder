## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: MCP Server Issue Detected**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible (`mcp__filesystem__read_file` returned "No such tool available"). This blocks all work according to CLAUDE.md requirements.

**The MCP server appears to be down or not properly configured.**

Please verify:
1. MCP server is running
2. MCP server configuration is correct
3. Required tools are properly registered

I cannot proceed with the task implementation until the MCP filesystem tools are available, as CLAUDE.md mandates their exclusive use for all file operations.
