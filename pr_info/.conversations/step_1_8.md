## Summary

**Step 7 Complete: Implement prompt_llm() for Full Session Management**

I successfully implemented Step 7 as specified in the task tracker. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `src/mcp_coder/llm_interface.py`**:
   - Added imports for `LLMResponseDict`, `ask_claude_code_cli`, `ask_claude_code_api`, and serialization functions
   - Updated `__all__` to export: `ask_llm`, `prompt_llm`, `serialize_llm_response`, `deserialize_llm_response`
   - Implemented `prompt_llm()` function that returns full `LLMResponseDict` with session_id and metadata
   - Added comprehensive docstring with practical examples for session management

2. **Modified `tests/test_llm_interface.py`**:
   - Added complete test suite for `prompt_llm()` with 18 test cases covering:
     - CLI and API method routing
     - Session ID continuity
     - Metadata preservation
     - Parameter validation (empty questions, invalid timeouts)
     - Custom parameters (timeout, cwd)
     - Error handling (unsupported provider/method)

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ **Pytest**: 35 passed, 1 skipped (fast unit tests only)
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found

### Commit Message:

```
