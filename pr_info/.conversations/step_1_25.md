Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **MCP SERVER ISSUE DETECTED**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md instructions, this blocks all work until resolved.

**Issue:** None of the mandatory MCP filesystem tools are available:
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__read_reference_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__list_directory`
- etc.

**This prevents me from:**
- Reading the task tracker
- Reading test documentation
- Implementing the core.py file
- Running code quality checks

**Required action:** The MCP server needs to be started/configured before I can proceed with any tasks. Please verify the MCP server is running and the filesystem tools are properly registered.

Would you like me to use standard Claude tools as a fallback, or should we resolve the MCP server issue first?
