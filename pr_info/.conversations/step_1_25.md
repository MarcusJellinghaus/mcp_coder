# Implementation Task: Create source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/client.py` with JenkinsClient class

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/client.py` with JenkinsClient class

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The TASK_TRACKER.md has been updated correctly. All the main implementation tasks for Step 2 are now marked as complete [x].

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task "Create source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/client.py` with JenkinsClient class":

### ‚úÖ What was implemented:

1. **JenkinsError Exception** - Base exception for all Jenkins operations with exception chaining
2. **_get_jenkins_config() Helper** - Configuration loader with environment variable priority over config file
3. **JenkinsClient Class** with:
   - `__init__()` - Initialize with server URL, username, and API token (fixed 30s timeout)
   - `start_job()` - Start Jenkins jobs with optional parameters, returns queue ID
   - `get_job_status()` - Get job status by queue ID (queued, running, SUCCESS, FAILURE, ABORTED, etc.)
   - `get_queue_summary()` - Get counts of running and queued jobs

### ‚úÖ Code Quality Verification:

- **Pytest**: All 24 tests pass ‚úÖ
- **Pylint**: No issues found ‚úÖ
- **Mypy**: No type errors ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Key Implementation Details:

- Uses `@log_function_call` decorator on all public methods
- Uses structlog for structured logging
- Configuration priority: Environment variables > Config file > None
- All exceptions wrapped as JenkinsError with exception chaining
- Fixed 30-second timeout for all operations
- Full type annotations with mypy strict mode compliance

### üìù Prepared Commit Message:

```
feat(jenkins): implement JenkinsClient with configuration and API methods

- Add JenkinsError exception for unified error handling
- Add _get_jenkins_config() helper with env var priority
- Add JenkinsClient class with start_job, get_job_status, and get_queue_summary methods
- All 24 unit tests pass with full test coverage
- Code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ‚úÖ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ‚úÖ Used MCP code-checker tools for quality checks
- ‚úÖ All code quality checks pass before completion

The implementation is complete and ready for the next step!
