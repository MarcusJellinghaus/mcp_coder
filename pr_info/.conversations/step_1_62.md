# Implementation Task: Add documentation comment before `CREATE_PLAN_COMMAND_TEMPLATE`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add documentation comment before `CREATE_PLAN_COMMAND_TEMPLATE`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me verify the task completion by reviewing what I did:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Add documentation comment before `CREATE_PLAN_COMMAND_TEMPLATE`

**What I implemented:**
1. ✅ Added comprehensive documentation comment before `CREATE_PLAN_COMMAND_TEMPLATE` in `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py`
2. ✅ The comment explains:
   - Purpose: Command templates for Jenkins workflows
   - Critical requirement: Jenkins workspace clones repository to `/workspace/repo`
   - Parameter constraint: `--project-dir` must match Jenkins workspace structure
   - Template pattern: 5-step workflow (checkout → pull → verify → sync → execute)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Pylint check: No issues found
- ✅ Pytest check: All 1121 tests passed
- ✅ Mypy check: No type errors found
- ✅ No code logic changes (documentation only)
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools for file operations
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked as complete in tracker

The task has been successfully completed. The documentation comment clearly explains the Jenkins workspace requirements and the template structure, making it easier for future developers to understand and maintain the code.
