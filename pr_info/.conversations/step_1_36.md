# Implementation Task: Fix 1: Remove sys.path manipulation from tests/conftest.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Fix 1: Remove sys.path manipulation from tests/conftest.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md.

## ✅ TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Task: Fix 1 - Remove sys.path manipulation from tests/conftest.py**

### Changes Made:
- Removed the sys.path manipulation block (lines 14-19) from `tests/conftest.py`
- This eliminates the code that added the src directory to Python's module search path
- Tests now use the properly installed package instead of directly accessing source files

### Verification:
- ✅ **Pytest**: 1022 tests passed (fast unit tests, excluding integration tests)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
refactor(step5): remove sys.path manipulation from conftest.py

Remove sys.path.insert() call that added src directory to module search path.
Tests now use properly installed package, avoiding import confusion and 
masking of packaging issues.
```

### Task Status:
- ✅ Marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- All CLAUDE.md requirements followed (MCP tools used exclusively, all checks passed)

The task is complete and ready for the next fix in Step 5!
