# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The bash command requires approval. According to the task requirements and the error messages, **the package must be reinstalled** for the tests to work because:

1. We created new package structure: `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`
2. Tests import from this new package location
3. The installed package doesn't have these new modules yet
4. This is explicitly mentioned in Step 4's validation notes

I need to inform you of this critical blocker:

## ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKER: Package Reinstall Required

**Issue:** The tests cannot run because the package needs to be reinstalled after creating the new package structure.

**Root Cause:**  
- We created `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/` package in previous steps
- Tests import from `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core`
- The installed package doesn't include these new modules yet
- This causes `ModuleNotFoundError` when pytest tries to import

**Required Action:**  
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Evidence:**  
All test files fail with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'
```

**Why This Is Required:**  
- Step 4 explicitly mentions: "requires package reinstall" for validation
- The editable install (`-e`) ensures source changes are reflected
- Without this, NO tests can import the new package structure

**Impact:**  
- Cannot complete Part B (Comprehensive Testing)
- Cannot verify code quality
- Blocks completion of Step 5

**Next Steps:**  
Please approve the command: `pip install -e .`

Or manually run it and then I can continue with testing.

Would you like me to proceed with the package reinstall?
