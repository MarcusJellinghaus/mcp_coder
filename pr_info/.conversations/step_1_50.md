# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_all_repos_mode()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_end_to_end_all_repos_mode()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully implemented the `test_end_to_end_all_repos_mode()` test as specified in Step 6 of the task tracker.

### What Was Implemented

**Test: `test_end_to_end_all_repos_mode()`**
- **Location**: `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:2553-2807`
- **Purpose**: Tests the `--all` mode with multiple repositories

**Key Test Features:**
1. **Multiple Repository Setup**: Mocks two repositories (`repo_one` and `repo_two`)
2. **Mock Configuration**: 
   - Mocked `get_config_file_path()` to return a fake path
   - Mocked `tomllib.load()` to return config data with two repos
   - Each repo has different configuration settings
3. **Issue Distribution**:
   - `repo_one`: 2 eligible issues (status-08 and status-02)
   - `repo_two`: 1 eligible issue (status-05)
4. **Manager Mocking**: Created separate IssueManager and IssueBranchManager instances for each repo
5. **Comprehensive Verification**:
   - All 3 issues from both repos were dispatched
   - Jenkins jobs triggered 3 times total
   - Labels updated correctly for all issues
   - Priority ordering maintained within each repo
   - Exit code 0 (success)

### Code Quality Checks

All checks passed successfully:
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 1113 tests pass (including the new test)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors (added type annotation for `mock_config_data`)

### Technical Details

**Import Added**: Added `Any` to the typing imports for proper type annotations

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Used `side_effect` functions to return different mock instances based on `repo_url`
- Properly mocked the config file reading using `builtins.open` and `tomllib.load`
- Ensured nested context managers work correctly for proper test isolation

### Files Modified

1. `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`:
   - Added `Any` to typing imports (line 5)
   - Added complete `test_end_to_end_all_repos_mode()` test method (lines 2553-2807)

2. `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`:
   - Marked task as complete: `- [x] Write test: test_end_to_end_all_repos_mode()`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
