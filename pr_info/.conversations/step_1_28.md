# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly: **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'`**

The package needs to be reinstalled in editable mode so Python can find the new module structure. According to the development process document, this requires running `pip install -e .[dev]`. 

However, I need to inform the user about this because I cannot execute Python commands that require approval. Let me update my understanding and inform the user about this blocker.

Actually, looking at the error more carefully, the issue is that the new module `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr` was created but the package hasn't been reinstalled to include it in the installed package. This is a known requirement mentioned in Step 4's validation section.

Let me inform the user about this situation:

**⚠️ TESTING BLOCKED - Package Reinstall Required**

I've identified the issue preventing comprehensive testing from proceeding:

## Problem

The tests are failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'
```

## Root Cause

In Steps 1-4, we created a new module structure `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/` with:
- `__init__.py`
- `core.py`

However, the mcp-coder package needs to be **reinstalled in editable mode** for Python to recognize this new module structure.

## Solution Required

**You need to run:**
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This will reinstall the package in editable mode, making the new `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr` module available to Python and pytest.

## What This Means for Part B

**I cannot complete Step 5 Part B (Comprehensive Testing) until the package is reinstalled.** All tests that import from `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core` will fail with import errors.

---

**Would you like me to:**

**A) Wait for you to run the reinstall command, then continue with testing**  
   - You run `pip install -e .[dev]`  
   - I then proceed with all comprehensive tests  

**B) Document this requirement and move forward with other validation**  
   - Update TASK_TRACKER.md to note the reinstall requirement  
   - Skip to manual testing that doesn't require package import  

**C) Something else?**

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!
