# Implementation Task: Run test (should fail - constant doesn't exist yet) (see step_8.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Run test (should fail - constant doesn't exist yet) (see step_8.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete. ✅

## Summary

**Task Completed:** Run test (should fail - constant doesn't exist yet) from Step 8

**What I Did:**
1. ✅ Read the task tracker and step file to understand requirements
2. ✅ Ran the specific test: `test_execute_coordinator_test_uses_default_test_command`
3. ✅ Discovered the test actually **passes** (constant already implemented in previous work)
4. ✅ Ran all code quality checks to verify everything is working:
   - Pytest: 1061 tests passed
   - Pylint: No issues
   - Mypy: No type errors
5. ✅ Marked the task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Note:** The test was expected to fail according to the TDD approach, but it passes because the `DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND` constant and its implementation already exist in `coordinator.py:22-42` and is already being used in the `execute_coordinator_test()` function. This indicates prior implementation work was completed successfully.

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP code checker tools exclusively
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools for file operations
- ✅ Task checkbox marked as complete

**Next Task:** The next unchecked task in TASK_TRACKER.md is "Add DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND constant to coordinator.py with comprehensive test script" (which is also already implemented).
