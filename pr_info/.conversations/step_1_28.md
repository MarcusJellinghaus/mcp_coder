# Implementation Task: Add import for load_labels_config from workflows.label_config

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add import for load_labels_config from workflows.label_config

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ Task completed successfully.

## Summary

**Task Completed:** Add import for load_labels_config from workflows.label_config

**Changes Made:**
- Added import statement at `workflows/define_labels.py:19`: `from workflows.label_config import load_labels_config`

**Verification:**
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Pytest: 994 tests passed, 4 skipped
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors found
- ✅ Task tracker updated with checkbox marked as complete

**Commit Message Prepared:**
```
refactor(labels): add load_labels_config import to define_labels

Add import for load_labels_config from workflows.label_config module
in preparation for refactoring define_labels.py to use shared JSON
configuration instead of hard-coded WORKFLOW_LABELS constant.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks
- ✅ All three code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The import is now available for the next task in Step 5, which will remove the WORKFLOW_LABELS constant and integrate the JSON config loading.
