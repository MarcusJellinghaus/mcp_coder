## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: The MCP filesystem tools are not currently accessible, but I can proceed using standard file tools as a fallback. I see that all tasks in the TASK_TRACKER.md appear to be complete (Steps 1-8 are marked as [x]). 

However, looking at the task description you mentioned: "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" - this doesn't match any of the steps in the TASK_TRACKER.md. Could you clarify which specific file and task you'd like me to work on? 

The tasks I see are all related to environment variable propagation across the LLM interface, and they appear to be complete. Is there a different task tracker or project plan I should be looking at?
