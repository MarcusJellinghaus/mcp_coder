# Implementation Task: Add `repo_url` parameter support to `BaseGitHubManager.__init__()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add `repo_url` parameter support to `BaseGitHubManager.__init__()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Add `repo_url` parameter support to `BaseGitHubManager.__init__()`

### Summary of Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/base_manager.py` - Added `repo_url` parameter support
2. `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/pr_manager.py` - Fixed type annotations for Optional[Path]

### Key Implementations:

1. **Modified `BaseGitHubManager.__init__()`**:
   - Added `repo_url` parameter (optional, mutually exclusive with `project_dir`)
   - Validates exactly one of (project_dir, repo_url) is provided
   - Initializes all attributes upfront with proper type annotations

2. **Created `_init_with_project_dir()` helper**:
   - Extracts existing project_dir validation logic
   - Sets up git.Repo object
   - Maintains backward compatibility

3. **Created `_init_with_repo_url()` helper**:
   - Parses GitHub URL to extract owner/repo
   - Stores parsed components for later use
   - No local git repository required

4. **Updated `_get_repository()`**:
   - Determines mode based on which attributes are set
   - Uses stored repo_full_name in repo_url mode
   - Falls back to git remote extraction in project_dir mode

5. **Fixed type compatibility issues**:
   - Added assertions in `PullRequestManager` to satisfy mypy
   - Ensures project_dir is non-None after initialization

### Verification Results:

✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
✅ **Pytest**: All 1065 tests passed
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
Add repo_url parameter support to BaseGitHubManager

- Add repo_url parameter to BaseGitHubManager.__init__()
- Implement _init_with_project_dir() and _init_with_repo_url() helpers
- Update _get_repository() to support both project_dir and repo_url modes
- Validate exactly one of (project_dir, repo_url) is provided
- Fix type annotations for Optional[Path] in PullRequestManager
- All tests pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
