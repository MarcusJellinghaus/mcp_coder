Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create integration tests for label CRUD operations

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I've successfully completed Step 3. Let me provide a summary:

## Task Completed: Integration Tests for Label CRUD Operations

**What was implemented:**

1. **Created `labels_manager` fixture** in `tests/utils/test_github_operations.py`:
   - Validates GitHub configuration (token and test repo URL)
   - Clones test repository
   - Creates LabelsManager instance for testing
   - Gracefully skips if configuration is missing

2. **Added `TestLabelsManagerIntegration` class** with comprehensive lifecycle test:
   - `test_labels_manager_lifecycle()`: Tests complete CRUD operations
     - Create label with unique timestamped name
     - Get specific label by name
     - List all labels
     - Update label (color and description)
     - Delete label
     - Verify deletion
   - Includes cleanup in `finally` block to ensure test labels are removed

3. **Quality checks completed:**
   - ✅ Pytest: All 17 unit tests pass
   - ✅ Pylint: No errors or fatal issues
   - ✅ Mypy: Expected type errors for methods not yet implemented (Step 4)

4. **Updated TASK_TRACKER.md**: Marked Step 3 as complete

**Commit message:**

```
test(labels): add integration tests for label CRUD operations
```

**Note:** The mypy errors are expected since the CRUD methods (`create_label`, `get_label`, `get_labels`, `update_label`, `delete_label`) haven't been implemented yet. They will be implemented in Step 4, at which point these tests will serve as the acceptance criteria.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
