Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: MCP Server Issues Detected**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md, this blocks all work until resolved. The required MCP tools like `mcp__filesystem__read_file` are not available.

**Available options:**
1. Check if the MCP server is running
2. Verify MCP server configuration
3. Restart the MCP server connection

Without access to MCP tools, I cannot proceed with the task as per the mandatory instructions in CLAUDE.md. Please resolve the MCP server connectivity issue first.
