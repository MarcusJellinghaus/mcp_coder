## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Prepare git commit message for step 2

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the next task from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Let me first read the file to understand what needs to be done.I can see that Step 2 is marked as complete except for the last subtask: "Prepare git commit message for step 2". Let me create the TodoWrite to track this task:Let me check what was accomplished in Step 2 by looking at the current state of the codebase and recent commits:I can see there's already a commit "feat: create PullRequestManager module structure" (e7d5bd1) which appears to be the commit for Step 2. Let me check what changes were made in that commit:Perfect! I can see that Step 2 has already been implemented and committed with the message "feat: create PullRequestManager module structure". This commit message is appropriate for Step 2 as it describes what was accomplished:

- Creating the PullRequestManager module structure
- Adding the basic class implementation
- Including proper docstrings and type hints
- Using the @log_function_call decorator
- Adding the factory function

The task "Prepare git commit message for step 2" appears to already be complete since the commit was made with an appropriate message. Let me mark this task as completed in the TASK_TRACKER.md:Perfect! The task "Prepare git commit message for step 2" has been completed. The git commit was already made with an appropriate message: "feat: create PullRequestManager module structure".

**Task Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED**

**What was accomplished:**
- Step 2 was already implemented and committed with the message: `feat: create PullRequestManager module structure`
- The commit message appropriately describes the work done in Step 2
- The TASK_TRACKER.md has been updated to mark this subtask as complete
- All of Step 2 is now fully complete

The commit message follows good conventions by:
- Using "feat:" prefix to indicate a new feature
- Clearly describing what was created (PullRequestManager module structure)
- Being concise but descriptive

Step 2 is now entirely complete and ready for the next step (Step 3: Write Failing Integration Test).
