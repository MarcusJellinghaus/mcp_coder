# Implementation Task: Part B: Implement CLI Command (GREEN Phase)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Implement CLI Command (GREEN Phase)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Still skipped. Let me ask the user for help with this issue:

I'm encountering an issue where the tests in `tests/cli/commands/test_create_pr.py` are all being skipped, even though I've created the `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_pr.py` module as required. 

The tests use a `@pytest.mark.skipif(not CREATE_PR_MODULE_AVAILABLE, ...)` decorator where `CREATE_PR_MODULE_AVAILABLE` is set based on whether the import succeeds:

```python
try:
    from mcp_coder.cli.commands.create_pr import execute_create_pr
    CREATE_PR_MODULE_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    CREATE_PR_MODULE_AVAILABLE = False
```

I've verified:
- `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_pr.py` exists and follows the exact pattern from `implement.py`
- `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/core.py` exists with the `run_create_pr_workflow()` stub
- All `__init__.py` files exist in the import path
- I've added the import to `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/__init__.py`

**Question:**  
Could you help me understand why the tests might still be skipping? Should I try running a bash command to test the import directly, or is there another approach I should take?
