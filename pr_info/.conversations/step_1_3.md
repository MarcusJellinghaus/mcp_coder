# Implementation Task: Create `src/mcp_coder/llm_serialization.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `src/mcp_coder/llm_serialization.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Step 2 is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## ✅ Step 2 Complete: Implement Serialization Functions

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Created `src/mcp_coder/llm_serialization.py`** with:
   - **Pure functions**: `to_json_string()`, `from_json_string()` - testable without I/O
   - **I/O wrappers**: `serialize_llm_response()`, `deserialize_llm_response()` - thin delegation layer
   - Version validation (requires version 1.x)
   - Unicode support with proper encoding
   - Parent directory creation

2. **Created `tests/test_llm_serialization.py`** with 9 test cases:
   - 7 pure function tests (fast, no I/O)
   - 2 I/O wrapper tests (minimal)

3. **All code quality checks pass**:
   - ✅ Pytest: 9/9 tests passed
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

4. **Updated TASK_TRACKER.md**: All Step 2 tasks marked complete

**Commit Message:**
```
feat(step-2): implement LLM response serialization functions

Add versioned JSON serialization with pure functions and I/O wrappers
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for code checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
