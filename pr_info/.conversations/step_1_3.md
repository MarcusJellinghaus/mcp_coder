# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
So the files were already created and committed. The problem is that the module can't be imported in the test environment. This is likely because:

1. The package was installed in editable mode in one venv (mcp_coder_prod)
2. New files were added but the package wasn't reinstalled
3. Python can't see the new jenkins_operations submodule

The solution is to reinstall the package. However, I don't have direct access to run the reinstall.bat script in the mcp_coder_prod venv.

Let me check if perhaps there's a way to make this work. Actually, looking at the git status earlier, I saw that the files are modified, not new. Let me see if maybe I need to check what the actual state of the venv is. 

Actually, I realize the real issue: the user is likely running this in an AutoRunner context where the mcp-coder package from `Code/mcp_coder` needs to be installed in the AutoRunner `.venv`. Let me ask the user about this:

**I've discovered the issue!** 

The test files and source files have been created successfully (they were actually created in previous commits). However, Python cannot import the `mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations` module because:

1. The files exist in `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder\src\mcp_coder\utils\jenkins_operations\`
2. The MCP code checker is using a venv at `mcp_coder_prod\.venv`  
3. The mcp-coder package in that venv was installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`) BEFORE the jenkins_operations module was created
4. With editable installs, new subpackages are usually auto-discovered, BUT there may be a caching issue or the package might need reinstallation

**To fix this, you need to reinstall the mcp-coder package.** Based on the AutoRunner project structure, you should:

1. Navigate to the AutoRunner root directory (or wherever `mcp_coder_prod\.venv` is located)
2. Run: `mcp_coder_prod\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e Code\mcp_coder`

Or if there's a reinstall script for the AutoRunner environment, run that.

Once the package is reinstalled, the tests should work. Would you like me to:
- **Option A**: Continue assuming the package will be reinstalled, and prepare the completion steps
- **Option B**: Investigate further to find where the `mcp_coder_prod` venv is and provide exact reinstall instructions

Which would you prefer?
