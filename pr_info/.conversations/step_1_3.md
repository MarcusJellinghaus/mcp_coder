# Implementation Task: Add EventData TypedDict after LabelData (around line 90)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add EventData TypedDict after LabelData (around line 90)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Complete!

I have successfully completed the task: **Add EventData TypedDict after LabelData (around line 90)**

### Summary of Changes:

**File Modified:** `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_manager.py:112-117`

Added the `EventData` TypedDict with the following structure:
```python
class EventData(TypedDict):
    """TypedDict for issue event data structure."""

    event: str  # Event type (e.g., "labeled", "unlabeled")
    label: Optional[str]  # Label name (for label events)
    created_at: str  # ISO format timestamp
    actor: Optional[str]  # GitHub username who performed action
```

### Verification Results:

✅ **Pylint:** No issues found  
✅ **Pytest:** All 56 tests in test_issue_manager.py pass  
✅ **Mypy:** No type errors found  
✅ **Task Tracker:** Updated to mark task as complete  

### Prepared Commit Message:

```
feat(issue-manager): add EventData TypedDict for event data structure

Add EventData TypedDict after LabelData (line 112) to support issue event 
timeline data. Includes fields for event type, label name, timestamp, and 
actor for tracking GitHub issue events like label changes.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks
- All code quality checks passed
- Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
