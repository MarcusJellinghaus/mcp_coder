# Implementation Task: Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_sys_prefix_fallback`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_sys_prefix_fallback`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete. Now let me prepare a concise git commit message for this change:

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task to add the test `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_sys_prefix_fallback` to `tests/llm/test_env.py`.

### What was done:
1. ✅ Added the new test function that verifies `sys.prefix` is used as a fallback when neither `VIRTUAL_ENV` nor `CONDA_PREFIX` environment variables are set
2. ✅ The test follows the TDD RED phase pattern - it defines the expected behavior but currently fails because the implementation hasn't been updated yet (this is correct and expected)
3. ✅ All code quality checks passed:
   - Pylint: No issues
   - Pytest: Test fails as expected (RED phase)
   - Mypy: No type errors
4. ✅ Task marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Commit Message:
```
test(env): add sys.prefix fallback test for runner environment

Add test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_sys_prefix_fallback to verify
that sys.prefix is used when no VIRTUAL_ENV or CONDA_PREFIX variables
are set. Test currently fails (TDD RED phase) and will pass after
implementation update in Step 2.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks completed and passed
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
