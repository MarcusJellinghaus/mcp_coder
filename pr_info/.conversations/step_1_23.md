Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **MCP SERVER ISSUE DETECTED** - The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. This blocks all work as per CLAUDE.md requirements.

The `mcp__filesystem__read_file` tool is not available, which means the MCP server is not properly configured or not running. According to the mandatory instructions in CLAUDE.md, I MUST use MCP tools for all file operations.

**I cannot proceed with the task until this is resolved.**

Please verify:
1. Is the MCP server running?
2. Is the MCP filesystem server properly configured in your Claude Code settings?
3. Are the MCP tools showing up in your available tools list?

Would you like me to attempt using standard file reading tools as a fallback, or would you prefer to fix the MCP server configuration first?
