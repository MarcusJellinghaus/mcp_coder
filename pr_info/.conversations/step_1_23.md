Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'm waiting for write permissions to be granted. I need to modify the test file `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\mcp_coder\tests\llm\providers\claude\test_claude_integration.py` to add the integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()`.

The test will verify that environment variables (MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR and MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR) are correctly propagated through both CLI and API methods when making real Claude Code calls.
