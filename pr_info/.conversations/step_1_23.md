# Implementation Task: Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - fix all issues

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Run quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy - fix all issues

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Complete: Quality Checks Passed

I've successfully completed the quality checks task for Step 1 of the Jenkins Job Automation feature. Here's the summary:

### ‚úÖ Quality Check Results

**1. Pylint Check**  
- Target: `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations`
- Result: **No issues found**
- Categories checked: error, fatal, warning, refactor, convention

**2. Pytest Check**  
- Target: `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py`
- Result: **12 tests passed** in 7.12 seconds
- All model tests passing successfully

**3. Mypy Check**  
- Target: `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations`
- Result: **No type errors found**
- Strict mode enabled

### üìã All Requirements Met

‚úÖ All three code quality checks passed without issues  
‚úÖ No fixes were needed - code was already compliant  
‚úÖ Task marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`  
‚úÖ All CLAUDE.md requirements followed (used MCP tools exclusively)

The jenkins_operations models implementation is fully validated and ready for the next step!
