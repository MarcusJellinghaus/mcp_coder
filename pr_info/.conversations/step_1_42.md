# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_coordinator_run_with_repo_argument()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_coordinator_run_with_repo_argument()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully completed the task! Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Task Completed: Write test `test_coordinator_run_with_repo_argument()`

**What was done:**
1. **Added new test** to `tests/cli/test_main.py`:
   - Created new test class `TestCoordinatorRunCommand`
   - Implemented `test_coordinator_run_with_repo_argument()` test
   - Test verifies CLI routing for `coordinator run --repo` mode
   - Mocks `execute_coordinator_run` to verify correct arguments are passed
   - Validates that command, subcommand, repo name, and flags are correctly parsed

**Test details:**
- Tests the command: `mcp-coder coordinator run --repo mcp_coder`
- Verifies that `execute_coordinator_run` is called with correct arguments:
  - `command == "coordinator"`
  - `coordinator_subcommand == "run"`
  - `repo == "mcp_coder"`
  - `all == False`
  - `log_level == "INFO"` (default)

**Code quality checks - ALL PASSED:**
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 1107 tests pass (including the new test)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

**Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md:**
- Changed `- [ ] Write test: test_coordinator_run_with_repo_argument()` to `- [x] Write test: test_coordinator_run_with_repo_argument()`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
