# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 0: SHOW CONFIGURATION TASK**
- Please check which MCP servers you have. What can you use them for? Which tools are you allowed to use. Please list them.
  Do you have full acces to the MCP servers / tools?
  
**STEP 1: ANALYSE .mcp.json**  
- Please check the `.mcp.json`. It contains some variables. Do you have all of them available as environment variables?
  Can you spot any issue?

**STEP 2: Check for issues**
- Please let me know whether you can use the MCP file system tools, and/or whether there is any issue. 
  If there is an issue, please investigate and report to me 
  
Pleae ignore the next few lines. They were put by technical mistake.  

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS - STEPS 0, 1, 2 COMBINED:

### ‚ùå **MAJOR ISSUES DETECTED:**

1. **MCP Filesystem Tools NOT Available**
   - Despite being listed in my tool descriptions, `mcp__filesystem__*` tools return "No such tool available"
   - The MCP filesystem server is configured in `.mcp.json` but not accessible

2. **Environment Variables NOT Set**
   - `VIRTUAL_ENV` - Not set (‚ùå)
   - `MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR` - Not set (‚ùå)
   - `MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR` - Not set (‚ùå)
   - `USERPROFILE` - Not set (‚ùå)

3. **Required Variables in .mcp.json:**
   - `${VIRTUAL_ENV}` - Used for executable paths
   - `${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}` - Project directory
   - `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` - Virtual environment path
   - `${USERPROFILE}` - User profile for reference projects

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPACT:**

**I CANNOT follow CLAUDE.md mandatory instructions** because:
- MCP filesystem tools are unavailable (must use standard Read/Write/Edit instead)
- MCP code-checker tools may also be unavailable (need to verify)
- The MCP servers likely failed to initialize due to missing environment variables

### üîç **ROOT CAUSE:**

The `.mcp.json` configuration requires environment variables that are not set in the current session. The MCP servers cannot start without these variables being properly defined.

### ‚úÖ **WHAT WORKS:**
- Standard Claude tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- I can still complete tasks using standard tools

### ‚ùå **WHAT DOESN'T WORK:**
- MCP filesystem tools (completely unavailable)
- Compliance with CLAUDE.md mandatory MCP tool usage requirements

**Would you like me to:**
1. Help you set up the required environment variables?
2. Proceed with the core.py implementation using standard tools?
3. Investigate the MCP server configuration further?
