# Implementation Task: Remove platform-specific warnings that are no longer relevant

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Remove platform-specific warnings that are no longer relevant

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task marked as complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Task Complete: Remove Platform-Specific Warnings

### Summary

I successfully completed the task of removing platform-specific warnings that are no longer relevant from the documentation.

### What I Did

1. **Searched for platform-specific warnings** across all documentation files using comprehensive grep patterns
2. **Found and removed one platform-specific warning** in `Claude Code.md`:
   - **Before:** `mcp add-from-claude-desktop` Add mcp config files from Claude Desktop, not working on windows
   - **After:** `mcp add-from-claude-desktop` Add mcp config files from Claude Desktop (limited platform support)
3. **Verified legitimate platform documentation** remains intact:
   - Configuration file paths in README.md (Windows vs macOS/Linux)
   - Architecture documentation historical notes
   - These are factual information, not warnings
4. **All code quality checks passed:**
   - ✅ Pytest: 982 tests passed
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

### Prepared Commit Message

```
docs(step4): remove platform-specific warning from Claude Code guide

Updated Claude Code.md to replace Windows-specific warning with neutral platform support note for mcp add-from-claude-desktop command.
```

### Task Tracker Updated

✅ Marked task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively and all code quality checks passed.
