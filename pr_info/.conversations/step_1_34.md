# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Ah! I see the issue. The tests are being skipped because `CREATE_PR_MODULE_AVAILABLE` is `False`, which means the import is failing. There must be an import error. The code tries to import from `mcp_coder.cli.commands.create_pr` but that module might not be importable if the package isn't installed in editable mode.

This explains why the `tests/workflows/create_pr/` tests also don't run - they're trying to import from `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core` which also won't work if the package isn't installed.

The issue is that after Step 2 created the new package structure, the package needs to be reinstalled. Let me inform the user about this blocker:

**BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**: The package `mcp-coder` needs to be reinstalled in editable mode after the restructuring in Steps 1-4. The tests are failing to collect because Python cannot import the new module structure (`mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core` and `mcp_coder.cli.commands.create_pr`).

**Required action**:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This needs to be run in the project directory to reinstall the package in editable mode so that the new package structure is recognized by Python.

Would you like me to attempt to reinstall the package, or would you prefer to do this manually? Note that I'll need approval to run Bash commands for this.
