## Summary

**Task completed:** Implement Label CRUD Methods (Step 4)

### What was implemented:

1. **`get_labels()`** - Lists all labels in the repository
2. **`get_label(name)`** - Retrieves a specific label by name
3. **`create_label(name, color, description)`** - Creates a new label
4. **`update_label(name, color, description, new_name)`** - Updates an existing label
5. **`delete_label(name)`** - Deletes a label

### Implementation details:

- Added `_get_repository()` helper method to get the GitHub Repository object
- All methods include proper validation and error handling
- Methods return typed dictionaries (`LabelData`) or empty dicts on failure
- Added proper type annotations for mypy compliance
- All methods use the PyGithub library for GitHub API interactions

### Testing:

✅ All 532 unit tests pass  
✅ GitHub integration tests pass (2 tests, 4 skipped due to missing config)  
✅ Pylint: No issues  
✅ Mypy: No type errors
