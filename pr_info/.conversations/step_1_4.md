# Implementation Task: Create workflows/label_config.py with load_labels_config() function

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create workflows/label_config.py with load_labels_config() function

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Let me verify the task completion by reviewing what was implemented:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Create workflows/label_config.py with load_labels_config() function

**What was implemented:**
- Created `workflows/label_config.py:1-31` with the `load_labels_config()` function
- The function loads label configuration from a JSON file
- Includes proper error handling for:
  - Missing config file (FileNotFoundError)
  - Invalid JSON (json.JSONDecodeError)
  - Missing required keys (ValueError)
- Added proper type annotations (Dict[str, Any])
- Returns a dictionary with 'workflow_labels' and 'ignore_labels' keys

**Code quality checks:**
- ✅ Pylint check: PASSED (no errors or warnings)
- ✅ Pytest check: PASSED (956 tests passed, 4 skipped)
- ✅ Mypy check: PASSED (no type errors)

**File created:**
- `workflows/label_config.py` - 31 lines, properly typed and documented

**Task tracker:**
- ✅ Updated `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` - marked task as complete `[x]`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- All code quality checks passed before completion
- Task properly marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
