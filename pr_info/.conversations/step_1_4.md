# Implementation Task: Write tests for `BaseGitHubManager` with `project_dir` (existing behavior)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write tests for `BaseGitHubManager` with `project_dir` (existing behavior)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All 13 new tests pass. Let me provide a summary of what was completed:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Write tests for `BaseGitHubManager` with `project_dir` (existing behavior)**

### What Was Implemented

I added a comprehensive test suite (`TestBaseGitHubManagerWithProjectDir`) to `tests/utils/github_operations/test_base_manager.py` with **13 test cases** covering:

#### Initialization Tests (5 tests)
1. ✅ `test_successful_initialization_with_project_dir` - Validates successful init with valid directory
2. ✅ `test_initialization_fails_directory_not_exists` - Error when directory doesn't exist
3. ✅ `test_initialization_fails_path_not_directory` - Error when path is not a directory
4. ✅ `test_initialization_fails_not_git_repository` - Error when not a git repository
5. ✅ `test_initialization_fails_no_github_token` - Error when GitHub token is missing

#### Repository Access Tests (8 tests)
6. ✅ `test_get_repository_with_project_dir_mode` - Extracts repo from git remote
7. ✅ `test_get_repository_caching` - Repository object is cached
8. ✅ `test_get_repository_no_origin_remote` - Returns None when no origin remote
9. ✅ `test_get_repository_invalid_github_url` - Returns None for non-GitHub URLs
10. ✅ `test_get_repository_github_api_error` - Handles GitHub API errors gracefully
11. ✅ `test_get_repository_generic_exception` - Handles unexpected exceptions
12. ✅ `test_ssh_url_format_parsing` - Parses SSH URL format correctly
13. ✅ `test_https_url_without_git_extension` - Handles HTTPS URLs without .git

### Code Quality Verification

All code quality checks pass:
- ✅ **Pytest**: 13/13 tests passed (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors in the modified file

### Task Status

The task has been marked as **complete** in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All quality checks passed before marking task complete
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
