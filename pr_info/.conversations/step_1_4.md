# Implementation Task: Create tests/workflows/implement/test_core.py (test-first approach)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create tests/workflows/implement/test_core.py (test-first approach)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I have successfully completed Step 4: Create tests/workflows/implement/test_core.py (test-first approach). 

## Summary

I have successfully implemented comprehensive tests for the core workflow orchestration module:

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ Created `tests/workflows/implement/test_core.py` with comprehensive test coverage (31 tests total)
- ✅ Tests cover all main functions: `resolve_project_dir`, `prepare_task_tracker`, `log_progress_summary`, and `run_implement_workflow`
- ✅ Fixed test assertions to handle proper path construction on Windows
- ✅ All tests pass (`Collected 31 tests | ✅ Passed: 31`)
- ✅ Pylint check passed with no issues
- ✅ Mypy check passed with no type errors
- ✅ Updated TASK_TRACKER.md to mark the implementation tasks as complete

**Test Coverage Includes:**
- **resolve_project_dir**: Path validation, error handling, filesystem checks
- **prepare_task_tracker**: Task tracker preparation logic, LLM integration, commit operations  
- **log_progress_summary**: Progress tracking and logging functionality
- **run_implement_workflow**: End-to-end workflow orchestration with all prerequisite checks
- **Integration tests**: Full workflow scenarios and error recovery patterns

The core module already existed and handles the main workflow orchestration as specified in the step requirements. The tests provide comprehensive coverage of the critical orchestration paths and ensure the workflow logic is properly validated.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for code quality checks and achieved 100% test pass rate with no pylint or mypy issues.
