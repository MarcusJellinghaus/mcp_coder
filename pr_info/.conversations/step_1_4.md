# Implementation Task: Part B: Implement CLI Command (GREEN Phase)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Implement CLI Command (GREEN Phase)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
AH! The configuration uses environment variables `${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}` and `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}`. These must be set incorrectly! They're pointing to the wrong directory (`mcp_coder_prod` instead of `Code/mcp_coder`).

Let me check if these environment variables are set. But wait, I can't directly check environment variables using Bash in this context. Let me think...

Actually, looking at the error message again, the test is running from:
```
C:\\Users\\Marcus\\Documents\\GitHub\\AutoRunner\\mcp_coder_prod\\.venv
```

But our current working directory is:
```
C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder
```

So the MCP code-checker is configured to run tests in a different project directory. This makes sense for the "AutoRunner" setup mentioned in the CLAUDE.md file - it's designed to run MCP tools on TARGET projects, not on the AutoRunner project itself.

But in this case, WE ARE working on mcp_coder itself! We need to run the tests in the CURRENT directory, not in a separate project.

The issue is that the environment variables are set to point to `mcp_coder_prod` (probably a production installation of mcp-coder) instead of the development version we're working on (`Code/mcp_coder`).

Let me check what the current working directory environment variables should be by looking at the `.mcp.json` file usage in the AutoRunner CLAUDE.md:

Looking back at the AutoRunner CLAUDE.md:
```
### Environment Variables
The `.mcp.json` configuration uses these environment variables:
- `${VIRTUAL_ENV}` - Path to the active virtual environment
- `${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}` - Project directory being analyzed
- `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` - Virtual environment for the target project
```

So `MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR` should be set to our current directory (`C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder`), but it's currently set to `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\mcp_coder_prod`.

This is an environment configuration issue. The tests ARE working correctly - they're just running in the wrong environment!

Let me ask the user for help with this since I can't modify environment variables:

I've identified the issue! The tests are being skipped because they're running in the wrong Python environment.

**Problem:** 
The MCP code-checker is running tests in `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\mcp_coder_prod\.venv` instead of the current working directory `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder`.

This is because the `.mcp.json` file uses environment variables `${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}` and `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` which are currently pointing to the wrong location.

**Evidence:**
When I ran the test, the error showed:
```
[gw0] win32 -- Python 3.13.0 C:\\Users\\Marcus\\Documents\\GitHub\\AutoRunner\\mcp_coder_prod\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.cli.commands.create_pr'
```

**What needs to happen:**
The environment variables need to be set so that:
- `MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR=C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder`
- `MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR=C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder\.venv` (or wherever the .venv is for this project)

**Question:** How should I proceed? Should I:
1. Wait for you to update the environment variables and then try again?
2. Try to use the standard `Read`/`Write`/`Bash` tools instead of MCP tools for now?
3. Something else?
