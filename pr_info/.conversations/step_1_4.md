# Implementation Task: Create `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py` with helper functions (see step_2.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py` with helper functions (see step_2.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully completed **Step 2: Repository Config Validation (TDD)** of the coordinator test command feature. Here's what was accomplished:

### ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

**File: `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py`**

The file was already created with all four required helper functions:

1. **`load_repo_config(repo_name: str)`** - Loads repository configuration from config file, returns dict with `repo_url`, `test_job_path`, and `github_credentials_id` or None if not found

2. **`validate_repo_config(repo_name: str, config: Optional[dict])`** - Validates that all required configuration fields are present, raises ValueError with helpful error messages

3. **`get_jenkins_credentials()`** - Loads Jenkins credentials with priority: environment variables > config file, raises ValueError if any credential is missing

4. **`format_job_output(job_path: str, queue_id: int, url: Optional[str])`** - Formats job trigger output messages with optional URL

### ‚úÖ Code Quality Checks - All Passed

- **Pylint**: ‚úÖ No errors found
- **Pytest**: ‚úÖ 1009 tests passed (fast unit tests excluding slow integration tests)
- **Mypy**: ‚úÖ No type errors found

### ‚úÖ All Tests Pass

All 15 tests in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py` pass:
- `TestLoadRepoConfig`: 3 tests
- `TestValidateRepoConfig`: 5 tests  
- `TestGetJenkinsCredentials`: 5 tests
- `TestFormatJobOutput`: 2 tests

### ‚úÖ Task Tracker Updated

All Step 2 tasks marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### üìù Prepared Commit Message

```
feat(coordinator): implement repository config validation

Implement helper functions for coordinator test command:
- load_repo_config: Load repository configuration from config file
- validate_repo_config: Validate required configuration fields
- get_jenkins_credentials: Load Jenkins credentials with env var priority
- format_job_output: Format job trigger output messages

All functions include comprehensive error handling with helpful messages.
Tests pass: pylint, pytest (1009 tests), mypy.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.

The implementation is ready to proceed to **Step 3: CLI Command Core Logic (TDD)**.
