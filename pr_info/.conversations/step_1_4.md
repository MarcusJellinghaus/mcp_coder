Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **MCP SERVER ISSUE DETECTED**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md, this blocks all work until resolved. The required MCP tools (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, etc.) are not available in the current environment.

**Issue:** MCP filesystem server appears to be offline or not properly configured.

**Required to proceed:**
- MCP filesystem server must be running and accessible
- Cannot use standard `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` tools per CLAUDE.md mandatory instructions

Please check the MCP server configuration and ensure the filesystem server is running. I cannot proceed with the task until MCP tools are available.
