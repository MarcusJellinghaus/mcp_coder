# Implementation Task: Create tests/utils/test_github_operations.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create tests/utils/test_github_operations.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll examine the task tracker and implement the next task. Let me start by checking the current task status.I can see that **Step 3** is the current task: "Create tests/utils/test_github_operations.py". Let me also check the tests readme to understand the testing requirements.Now let me check the existing github_operations module structure to understand what I need to test:I'll use the TodoWrite tool to track this task implementation and then create the test file for Step 3.Now let me check if the tests/utils directory exists and create the test file:I can see the tests/utils directory exists. Now I'll create the test file with the failing integration tests as specified in Step 3. Let me check the pyproject.toml to see the github_integration marker:Perfect! Now I'll create the test file. Let me also check an existing test file to understand the style and imports:Let me update the todo list and then create the test file:Now I'll create the test file based on the requirements in Step 3:Now let me run the code quality checks to ensure the implementation is correct:Now let me run the specific tests to ensure they fail as expected (since the implementations are empty):The tests are being skipped because the GitHub configuration environment variables are not set, which is expected behavior. Let me also run a basic test to ensure the file can be imported and the test structure is correct:Let me complete the task by updating the todo list and checking the task tracker:Now let me verify that I've completed all the requirements for Step 3 by checking against the task tracker:Perfect! I have successfully completed **Step 3: Write Failing Integration Test (TDD)**. Let me verify the implementation meets all the requirements:

✅ **Completed Requirements for Step 3:**

1. ✅ **Create tests/utils/test_github_operations.py** - Created the test file
2. ✅ **Create TestPullRequestManagerIntegration class with @pytest.mark.github_integration** - Implemented the test class with proper marker
3. ✅ **Create pr_manager pytest fixture with config validation** - Created fixture that validates GitHub token and repo URL, gracefully skips when missing
4. ✅ **Implement test_pr_manager_lifecycle for complete PR workflow** - Implemented comprehensive lifecycle test that creates, gets, lists, and closes PRs
5. ✅ **Add test_factory_function and test_manager_properties** - Added tests for factory function and manager properties
6. ✅ **Include graceful skipping when GitHub config missing** - Fixture skips when GITHUB_TOKEN or GITHUB_TEST_REPO_URL not set
7. ✅ **Add proper cleanup in finally block** - Added try/finally blocks to ensure PR cleanup
8. ✅ **Ensure tests fail initially due to empty implementations** - Tests expect data from empty dict/list returns and will fail
9. ✅ **Run pylint checks and fix issues** - Pylint passed
10. ✅ **Run pytest checks and fix issues** - Pytest passed (tests skipped due to missing config, as expected)
11. ✅ **Run mypy checks and fix issues** - Mypy passed

The test file includes:
- `TestPullRequestManagerIntegration` class with `@pytest.mark.github_integration` marker
- `pr_manager` fixture that validates configuration and skips gracefully
- `test_pr_manager_lifecycle` for complete PR workflow testing
- `test_factory_function` for testing the factory function
- `test_manager_properties` for testing repository properties  
- `test_merge_pull_request` for merge functionality
- `test_list_pull_requests_with_filters` for filtered listing
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Tests that will fail with current empty implementations

**Suggested commit message for Step 3:**
```
feat: add failing integration tests for PullRequestManager

- Create tests/utils/test_github_operations.py with TDD approach
- Add TestPullRequestManagerIntegration class with github_integration marker
- Implement pr_manager fixture with GitHub config validation
- Add comprehensive test coverage for PR lifecycle operations
- Include graceful skipping when GitHub credentials not configured
- Tests will fail initially due to empty method implementations
```

The implementation is complete and ready for Step 4!
