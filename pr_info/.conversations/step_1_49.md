# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task is now marked as complete with `[x]`. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Complete: `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()` ✅

### Summary

**Task:** Write test: `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()`

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Done

1. **Verified Test Exists**: The test `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()` was already implemented in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py` (lines 2345-2538)

2. **Fixed Related Bugs**: Found and fixed two tests that were using `mock_load_labels` without the proper `@patch` decorator:
   - `test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues` - Added `@patch("mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator.load_labels_config")` and `mock_load_labels` parameter
   - `test_execute_coordinator_run_dispatch_failure_fail_fast` - Added `@patch("mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator.load_labels_config")` and `mock_load_labels` parameter

3. **Code Quality Verification**: All checks pass:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Pytest: 1,112 tests passed (including the target test)
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

4. **Task Tracker Updated**: Marked the task as complete `[x]` in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Commit Message Prepared

```
test(coordinator): verify end-to-end single repo multiple issues test

The test `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()` was already implemented
and passing. This commit verifies its correctness and fixes two related test bugs
where `mock_load_labels` was used without the corresponding `@patch` decorator.

Fixed tests:
- test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues
- test_execute_coordinator_run_dispatch_failure_fail_fast

All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy).
```

### Test Coverage

The `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues()` test validates:
- Complete end-to-end workflow with 3 issues (one per workflow type)
- Priority ordering: status-08 → status-05 → status-02
- Correct workflow dispatch: create-pr, implement, create-plan
- Correct label transitions: 08→09, 05→06, 02→03
- Jenkins job triggering and status checking
- Exit code 0 (success)

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** ✅
