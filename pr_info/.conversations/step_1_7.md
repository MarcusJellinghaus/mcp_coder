## Summary

**Task completed successfully!** ✅

I've implemented Step 6: Add environment preparation to `execute_prompt()` in `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/prompt.py`

### What was implemented:

1. **Added imports** (src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/prompt.py:27-31):
   - `from pathlib import Path`
   - `from ...llm.env import prepare_llm_environment`

2. **Added environment preparation** (src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/prompt.py:74-82):
   - Prepares environment variables using `prepare_llm_environment(Path.cwd())`
   - Gracefully handles `RuntimeError` when no venv is found (sets `env_vars=None`)
   - Logs warning but continues execution for backward compatibility

3. **Passed env_vars to all LLM calls**:
   - `prompt_llm()` call (line 135)
   - `ask_llm()` call (line 148)
   - `ask_claude_code_api_detailed_sync()` call (line 167)

4. **Updated tests** (tests/cli/commands/test_prompt.py):
   - Added 2 new tests:
     - `test_execute_prompt_with_env_vars`: Verifies env preparation and passing
     - `test_execute_prompt_no_venv_graceful`: Tests graceful handling when no venv
   - Updated all 7 existing tests to mock `prepare_llm_environment`

### Verification:

- ✅ **Pytest**: All 9 tests pass (7 existing + 2 new)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors

### Suggested commit message:

```
feat(cli): add environment preparation to execute_prompt()

Add environment variable preparation to the prompt command's execute_prompt()
function, enabling MCP servers to access project and venv paths via env vars.
Gracefully degrades when no venv is found for backward compatibility.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** ✅
