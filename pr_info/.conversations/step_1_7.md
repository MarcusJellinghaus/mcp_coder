# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'm getting approval requests for all Bash commands. Let me take a different approach. Based on my analysis, the issue is clear:

**Problem**: The `mcp-coder` package is installed in editable mode in the parent AutoRunner venv (`C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\mcp_coder_prod\.venv`), but after adding the new `jenkins_operations` subpackage, Python can't find it because the package metadata hasn't been updated.

**Solution**: The package needs to be reinstalled in the parent venv.

Let me check if I can use the Read tool for the reinstall script without approval:

Actually, since I'm blocked from running commands, let me communicate this to the user and ask them to run the reinstall:

## Issue Identified: Package Reinstall Required

The tests are failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations'` because:

1. The MCP code checker is using the AutoRunner parent venv at `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\mcp_coder_prod\.venv`
2. The `mcp-coder` package is installed in that venv in editable mode (`pip install -e Code/mcp_coder`)
3. The new `jenkins_operations` subpackage was added after the original installation
4. Python's editable install metadata needs to be refreshed to discover the new subpackage

**Required Action**: Please run the reinstall script to update the package installation:

```batch
cd C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner
reinstall_coder.bat
```

This will reinstall `mcp-coder` in editable mode and Python will be able to discover the new `jenkins_operations` subpackage.

**Alternative**: If you'd like me to try to run the reinstall, please approve the Bash command requests so I can execute the batch script.

Should I proceed after you run the reinstall, or would you like me to attempt the reinstall if you approve the Bash commands?
