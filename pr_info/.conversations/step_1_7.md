# Implementation Task: Extend `tests/cli/test_main.py` with coordinator CLI tests (see step_4.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Extend `tests/cli/test_main.py` with coordinator CLI tests (see step_4.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need user approval to run the reinstall script. The issue is that the code I've been reviewing is in the development directory (`local-windows/targets/mcp_coder/`), but the tests are running against the production installation (`local-windows/mcp_coder_prod/`). 

The coordinator command implementation is already complete in the source files:
1. ✅ Tests added to `tests/cli/test_main.py` - `TestCoordinatorCommand` class
2. ✅ Implementation added to `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py` - coordinator parser and routing

However, the changes need to be installed into the production environment before the tests will pass. This requires running `tools/reinstall.bat`.

**Summary of the situation:**
- The implementation is complete in the source code
- The tests are comprehensive and correctly written
- The tests are failing because they're running against an outdated production installation
- We need to run `tools/reinstall.bat` to sync the code to the production environment

**User:** I need your approval to run `tools/reinstall.bat` which will install the current development code into the production environment so that the tests can run against the updated code. Should I proceed?
