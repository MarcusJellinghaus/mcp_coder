## LLM Response:
## Summary

Successfully completed the task: **Copy parse_arguments() from workflows/create_PR.py to workflows/define_labels.py**

### What was implemented:

✅ **parse_arguments() function** - Copied from create_PR.py with modifications:
- Removed `--llm-method` argument (not needed for label management)
- Kept `--project-dir` and `--log-level` arguments
- Added `--dry-run` flag with `action='store_true'` and `default=False`
- Updated description to "Define workflow status labels for GitHub repository."

✅ **resolve_project_dir() function** - Copied from create_PR.py with full validation:
- Resolves to absolute path
- Validates directory exists and is accessible
- Confirms it's a git repository

✅ **Required imports** - Added `argparse` and `Optional` from typing

✅ **Code quality checks** - All passed:
- Pylint: No issues found
- Mypy: No issues in define_labels.py (pre-existing issues in other files)
- Pytest: 96 tests passed

### Commit message:

```
feat(workflows): add CLI argument parsing to define_labels.py

Add parse_arguments() and resolve_project_dir() functions with support for --project-dir, --log-level, and --dry-run flags.
```

**Note:** The task description mentioned adding 4 tests for argument parsing, but that's marked as a separate subtask in TASK_TRACKER.md and will be handled in the next step.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
