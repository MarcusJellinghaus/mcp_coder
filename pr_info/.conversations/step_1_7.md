Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Modify `src/mcp_coder/llm_interface.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me provide a summary:

## Step 6 Complete ✅

**Implementation Summary:**

**Modified Files:**
- `src/mcp_coder/llm_interface.py`: Added `session_id` parameter to `ask_llm()` function
- `tests/test_llm_interface.py`: Updated existing tests and added new session_id tests

**Changes Made:**

1. ✅ Added `session_id: str | None = None` parameter to `ask_llm()` function signature
2. ✅ Passed `session_id` through to `ask_claude_code()` 
3. ✅ Maintained return type as `str` (backward compatible)
4. ✅ Updated docstring with session parameter explanation and pointer to `prompt_llm()`
5. ✅ Added 5 new test cases for session_id functionality
6. ✅ Fixed existing test mocks to return `LLMResponseDict` instead of strings (compatibility with Step 5)
7. ✅ All code quality checks passed: pylint, pytest (20/20 passing), mypy

**Quality Check Results:**
- Pylint: ✅ No issues
- Pytest: ✅ 20 passed, 1 skipped (integration test)
- Mypy: ✅ No type errors

**Commit Message:**

```
