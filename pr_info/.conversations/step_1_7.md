# Implementation Task: Part A: Create Workflow Package Structure

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part A: Create Workflow Package Structure

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task tracker has been successfully updated. Let me provide a final summary:

## ✅ TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Task:** Step 2, Part A: Create Workflow Package Structure

**What was accomplished:**

1. ✅ Created `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/__init__.py`  
   - Package initialization file with proper exports

2. ✅ Created `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/core.py`  
   - Migrated from `workflows/create_PR.py`
   - Removed duplicate functions: `parse_arguments()`, `resolve_project_dir()`, `main()`
   - Updated `generate_pr_summary()` signature to accept `provider` and `method` parameters
   - Created `run_create_pr_workflow()` function with binary return codes (0/1)
   - Fixed mypy type error in error message handling

3. ✅ All code quality checks pass:
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Mypy: No type errors
   - Pytest: 1088 passed, 15 skipped (fast unit tests only)

4. ✅ Task tracker updated: Part A marked as complete

**Prepared commit message:**
```
feat(workflows): create create_pr workflow package structure

Migrate create_PR.py to new package structure:
- Created src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/__init__.py
- Created src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/core.py
- Removed duplicate functions (parse_arguments, resolve_project_dir, main)
- Updated generate_pr_summary() to accept provider and method parameters
- Created run_create_pr_workflow() with binary return codes (0/1)
- All code quality checks pass (pylint, mypy, pytest)

This is Step 2 Part A of Issue #139 implementation.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, mypy, pytest with fast unit tests)
- ✅ Task tracker properly updated with checkboxes marked as complete
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved

The workflow package structure is now ready for the next step (Part B: Update Existing Tests).
