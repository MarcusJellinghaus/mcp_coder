Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Extend tests/test_create_pr.py with main workflow tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the next task from the task tracker. Let me first examine the task tracker and then the current state of the tests to understand what needs to be done.Now let me examine the current test file to understand what's already implemented:Now let me check the tests readme to understand what tests should be run:Now let me examine the current workflows/create_PR.py to understand what main workflow functionality needs to be tested:I'll start by creating a todo list to track the implementation of main workflow tests for Step 4, then implement the required tests.Now let me examine the task details to understand what the main workflow should do:Let me check what files exist in the pr_info directory:Let me check the step 4 details:Now let me check the implement.py file to understand the structure I need to copy:Now I'll add the main workflow tests to the test file. Let me examine what other helper functions I need to use:Now let me also check the PullRequestManager to understand the GitHub integration:Now let me check what functions are available in workflow_utils for task tracking:Now I'll add the main workflow tests to the test file. Based on my analysis, I need to implement tests for:

1. Main workflow function
2. Helper functions for PR summary parsing, prerequisites checking, PR generation, cleanup, and PR creation
3. End-to-end workflow testing with mocksNow I'll add the main workflow test classes at the end of the file:Now I need to implement the main workflow functions in workflows/create_PR.py. Let me add all the required functions:Now I'll add all the main workflow functions at the end of the file:Now let me run the fast unit tests to verify the implementation:I need to fix the test - it's expecting positional arguments but the actual call uses keyword arguments. Let me fix this:Now let me run the tests again:I see the issue. The test is calling `sys.exit(1)` when PR creation fails, but the mock is continuing to execute and hitting the success path which calls `sys.exit(0)`. I need to make the mocked `main()` function properly exit when `sys.exit()` is called. Let me fix this:Now I need to fix the other main workflow tests that also use `sys.exit`:Now let me run the tests again to see if they pass:Excellent! All tests are now passing. Let me update the todo and run the code quality checks:I need to fix the mypy type annotation issues in the test file. Let me add the missing type annotations:Let me continue fixing the type annotations for the remaining test methods:Let me continue fixing the remaining type annotations and then run the checks again:Now let me fix the main workflow test function type annotations:Now let me run mypy again to see if all the type annotation issues are fixed:Excellent! All type checking issues are resolved. Let me run the tests one more time to make sure everything is still working:Perfect! Let me update my todo list and check the task tracker to confirm task completion:Now let me check the task tracker to review what was expected for this task:Perfect! I have successfully completed the task "Extend tests/test_create_pr.py with main workflow tests" for Step 4. Let me summarize what I accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

✅ **Step 4: Extend tests/test_create_pr.py with main workflow tests**

**What I implemented:**

1. **Added comprehensive test coverage for main workflow functions:**
   - `TestParsePrSummary` - Tests for parsing LLM responses into PR title/body
   - `TestCheckPrerequisites` - Tests for validating workflow prerequisites
   - `TestGeneratePrSummary` - Tests for generating PR summaries using LLM
   - `TestCleanupRepository` - Tests for repository cleanup operations
   - `TestCreatePullRequest` - Tests for GitHub PR creation
   - `TestMainWorkflow` - Tests for complete end-to-end workflow execution

2. **Implemented main workflow functions in workflows/create_PR.py:**
   - `parse_pr_summary()` - Parses LLM responses with KISS fallback
   - `check_prerequisites()` - Validates git status, tasks, and branch state
   - `generate_pr_summary()` - Creates PR summary using LLM and git diff
   - `cleanup_repository()` - Orchestrates cleanup operations
   - `create_pull_request()` - Creates GitHub PR using PullRequestManager
   - `main()` - Complete workflow orchestration with 4-step process
   - Supporting utilities: `parse_arguments()`, `resolve_project_dir()`, `log_step()`

3. **Added proper error handling and logging:**
   - Comprehensive prerequisite validation
   - Graceful failure handling with proper exit codes
   - Progress indicators for user feedback
   - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

4. **Quality assurance completed:**
   - ✅ All 37 unit tests passing
   - ✅ Pylint check passed (no issues)
   - ✅ Mypy check passed (all type annotations fixed)
   - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with mocked dependencies

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Linear 4-step workflow:** Prerequisites → PR Summary → Create PR → Cleanup
- **Safety-first approach:** PR creation before cleanup to ensure main goal is achieved
- **KISS principle:** Simple fallbacks for LLM failures, clear error messages
- **Robust testing:** All external dependencies mocked, error scenarios covered
- **CLI compatibility:** Reused argument parsing and logging patterns from implement.py

The implementation follows the exact requirements from the step 4 details, copying infrastructure from implement.py while replacing the workflow loop with linear PR creation steps. All tests pass and the code is ready for the next step in the workflow.

**Suggested commit message:** `feat(create_pr): complete main workflow tests and implementation for step 4`
