# Implementation Task: Implement parse_arguments() with --project-dir, --log-level, --dry-run

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement parse_arguments() with --project-dir, --log-level, --dry-run

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Implement parse_arguments() with --project-dir, --log-level, --dry-run

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The `parse_arguments()` function was already fully implemented in `workflows/validate_labels.py:28-59` with all required arguments:

1. **--project-dir**: Accepts project directory path (optional, defaults to current directory)
2. **--log-level**: Accepts logging level with choices ["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"], defaults to "INFO"
3. **--dry-run**: Boolean flag for preview mode without making changes

### Verification Results:

✅ **Implementation**: Function properly defined with correct argument specifications
✅ **Tests**: 6 comprehensive unit tests in `tests/workflows/test_validate_labels.py` - all passing
✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found
✅ **Pytest**: All 6 tests passed successfully
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Files Modified:
- `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`: Marked task as complete `[x]`

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for code quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The implementation follows the existing patterns from other workflow scripts and includes proper type hints, documentation, and comprehensive test coverage.
