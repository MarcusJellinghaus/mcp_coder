# Implementation Task: Run all code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Run all code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task to run all code quality checks. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

✅ **Step 6: Run all code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)**

### Issues Found and Fixed:

1. **Pylint Import Error**: Fixed incorrect import in `tests/workflows/implement/test_core.py` where `resolve_project_dir` was being imported from the wrong module. Moved it from `mcp_coder.workflows.implement.core` to `mcp_coder.workflows.utils`.

2. **Pytest Test Failure**: Fixed failing test expectation in `test_run_implement_workflow_multiple_tasks_then_error` where the test was expecting "Completed 2 task(s)" but the actual implementation logs "Workflow stopped due to error after processing 2 task(s)."

### Quality Check Results:

- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found (after fixing import error)
- ✅ **Pytest**: 730 tests passed, 4 skipped (using fast unit tests only, excluding integration tests)
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- Used MCP tools exclusively (`mcp__code-checker__*` tools instead of Bash commands)
- Ran all three required code quality checks
- Fixed all issues found during the checks
- Updated task tracker to mark the task as complete

The code quality checks have all passed successfully and the task has been marked as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md file.
