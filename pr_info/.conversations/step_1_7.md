# Implementation Task: Add Section 1.5 to test_complete_issue_workflow integration test

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add Section 1.5 to test_complete_issue_workflow integration test

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ **STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE**

All tasks for Step 4 have been successfully marked as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md file.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Add Section 1.5 to test_complete_issue_workflow integration test**

### What was implemented:
✅ Added Section 1.5 to the integration test (`tests/utils/github_operations/test_issue_manager_integration.py:102-120`)
- Calls `get_issue()` method after issue creation
- Verifies all fields match: number, title, body, state
- Checks `assignees` field exists and is a list
- Prints success message with assignees data

### Code Quality Checks:
✅ **Pylint**: PASSED (no errors)
✅ **Mypy**: PASSED (no type errors)
✅ **Pytest**: Unit tests passed (pre-existing failures in unrelated modules)

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
test: add Section 1.5 get_issue verification to integration test

Add Section 1.5 to test_complete_issue_workflow integration test to verify
get_issue() method retrieves issue data correctly after creation. Tests
round-trip functionality: create → get → compare fields including assignees.
```

### ✅ All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- Used MCP code checker tools exclusively
- Ran all three quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- Used MCP filesystem tools for file operations
- All checkboxes in TASK_TRACKER.md marked as complete

The task is now complete and ready for the next step in the workflow.
