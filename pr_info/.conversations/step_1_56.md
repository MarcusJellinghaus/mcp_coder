# Implementation Task: Add import: from mcp_coder.workflows.utils import resolve_project_dir

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add import: from mcp_coder.workflows.utils import resolve_project_dir

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **"Add import: from mcp_coder.workflows.utils import resolve_project_dir"**

### What I Did:
1. ✅ Added the import statement at line 22 in `workflows/validate_labels.py`
2. ✅ Placed it correctly with other `mcp_coder` imports
3. ✅ Verified the import points to an existing function in `src/mcp_coder/workflows/utils.py`
4. ✅ Confirmed pylint passes (no style issues)
5. ✅ Confirmed mypy detects the expected duplicate definition (will be resolved in next task)
6. ✅ Prepared commit message
7. ✅ Marked both the commit message preparation task and main task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

### Commit Message:
```
feat(validate_labels): add import for resolve_project_dir - Step 6

Add import statement for resolve_project_dir from mcp_coder.workflows.utils
to prepare for removing duplicate function definition.
```

### Expected Behavior:
- The mypy error about "Name 'resolve_project_dir' already defined" is **expected** because both the import and the local function exist
- This will be resolved in the **next task** which deletes the duplicate local function (~50 lines)
- The import is correct and ready to use

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations.
