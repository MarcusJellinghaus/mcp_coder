# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_no_open_issues()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_no_open_issues()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Task Complete: `test_no_open_issues()`

I have successfully implemented the `test_no_open_issues()` test as requested.

### What Was Implemented

**Test Location:** `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:3645-3738`

**New Test Class:** `TestCoordinatorRunEdgeCases`
- This is a new test class for edge case testing of the coordinator run functionality

**Test: `test_no_open_issues()`**
- Tests the scenario when a repository has no open issues at all
- Verifies that the coordinator gracefully handles empty issue lists
- Confirms exit code 0 (success) is returned - having no issues is not an error condition
- Validates that no Jenkins jobs are triggered when there are no issues
- Ensures no label updates occur when there are no issues

### Test Details

The test mocks:
- Config creation (`create_default_config`)
- Repository configuration loading (`load_repo_config`)
- Label configuration (`load_labels_config`)
- Jenkins credentials retrieval
- IssueManager with an **empty list** of issues (`list_issues.return_value = []`)

The test verifies:
1. Exit code 0 (success)
2. IssueManager initialized correctly with repo_url
3. `list_issues()` called with correct parameters
4. No label operations performed (no `remove_labels` or `add_labels` calls)

### Code Quality Verification

✅ **Pytest**: Test passes successfully
✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### TASK_TRACKER.md Updated

The task has been marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`:
- Changed `- [ ] Write test: test_no_open_issues()` to `- [x] Write test: test_no_open_issues()`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- All checks passed before marking complete
