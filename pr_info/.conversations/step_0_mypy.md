## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Fix the mypy type errors shown in the output below.

Focus only on resolving the type errors - do not make unnecessary changes to the code.

For each error:
1. Understand the type mismatch or missing annotation
2. Add appropriate type hints or fix incorrect types
3. Use proper typing imports (List, Dict, Optional, etc.) from typing module
4. Ensure all function parameters and return types are properly annotated

Keep changes minimal and focused on type correctness.

Expected output: Code changes that resolve all type errors while maintaining functionality.

## LLM Fix Response:
All mypy type errors have been resolved. 

## Summary

The mypy errors were caused by missing type stubs for the `requests` library. The fix was to add a mypy override in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = ["requests.*", "requests"]
ignore_missing_imports = true
follow_imports = "skip"
```

This configuration tells mypy to:
1. Ignore missing imports for the `requests` module and its submodules
2. Skip following imports from the `requests` package

The change was made to `pyproject.toml` at line 150-153, following the pattern already established for other third-party libraries like `jenkins` and `pyperclip`.
