## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE: MCP tools are not accessible** - This blocks all work until resolved.

The MCP filesystem tools (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, etc.) are not available. According to CLAUDE.md, I must immediately alert you to this issue as it prevents me from following the mandatory instructions.

**The following MCP tools are required but unavailable:**
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__save_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`
- And other filesystem operations

**Action needed:** Please ensure the MCP server is properly configured and running so I can access the required tools to complete this task.
