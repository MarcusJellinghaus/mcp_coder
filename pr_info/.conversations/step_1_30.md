# Implementation Task: Check setup/installation guides (if they exist)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Check setup/installation guides (if they exist)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## ✅ TASK COMPLETE

### Summary

**Task:** Check setup/installation guides (if they exist)

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Searched entire project for installation/setup documentation files (INSTALL.md, SETUP.md, etc.) - **none found**
2. ✅ Reviewed all existing documentation for setup/installation content:
   - README.md - Basic pip install only, no venv requirements
   - Claude Code.md - Claude CLI setup, no venv requirements
   - tests/README.md - Test execution, no venv requirements
   - docs/architecture/*.md - No environment detection mentions
3. ✅ Verified no outdated venv requirements or platform-specific warnings exist
4. ✅ All code quality checks passed (pytest: 1022 tests, pylint: no errors, mypy: no type errors)
5. ✅ Marked task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Result:** No setup/installation guides require updates. The minimal documentation that exists is already correct and aligned with the new simplified environment detection approach.

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively (mcp__filesystem__ for file operations, mcp__code-checker__ for quality checks)
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
