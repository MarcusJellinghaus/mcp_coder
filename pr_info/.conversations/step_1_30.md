# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Good, we're in the correct directory. The issue is that the package needs to be reinstalled in editable mode so pytest can discover the new module structure. Let me ask the user about this:

Based on my analysis, the tests aren't being discovered because the package needs to be reinstalled after the file structure changes we made in previous steps. The tests are trying to import from `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core`, but this new package structure isn't available until we reinstall the package.

**Question: Package Reinstall Needed**

The comprehensive testing in Part B cannot proceed without reinstalling the package in editable mode. This is necessary because we moved files to a new package structure (`src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`).

**Options:**

**A) Reinstall package now and continue testing**
- Run: `pip install -e .` to reinstall in editable mode
- Then proceed with comprehensive testing
- Pro: Allows us to complete all testing tasks
- Con: Requires package reinstallation step

**B) Skip testing and mark as blocked**
- Mark testing tasks as blocked/requires user action
- Pro: Doesn't make assumptions about environment changes
- Con: Cannot complete the assigned task

**Which option would you prefer?** Or would you like to reinstall the package yourself and then I'll proceed with testing?
