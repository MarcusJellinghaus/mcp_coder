# Implementation Task: Remove `Any` from typing imports in test_coordinator.py (see step_9.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Remove `Any` from typing imports in test_coordinator.py (see step_9.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Step 9 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:

## ✅ Step 9 Complete: Clean Up Test Imports

**What was implemented:**
1. ✅ Removed `Any` from typing imports in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:5`
2. ✅ Replaced all 8 occurrences of `pytest.CaptureFixture[Any]` with `pytest.CaptureFixture[str]`
3. ✅ Verified no remaining `Any` usage with grep
4. ✅ All code quality checks passed:
   - Pytest: 1061 tests passed
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Mypy: No type errors found

**Changes made:**
- `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`: Updated type hints in 8 test functions + removed import

**Git commit message prepared:**
```
refactor(tests): replace Any with str in CaptureFixture type hints

Remove unused Any import from test_coordinator.py and replace all
pytest.CaptureFixture[Any] with pytest.CaptureFixture[str] for more
specific type hints. This improves type safety and follows Python
typing best practices.

- Remove Any from typing imports
- Update 8 test function signatures to use CaptureFixture[str]
- All tests pass with improved type hints
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The implementation improves type safety by replacing the generic `Any` type with the more specific `str` type for pytest's `CaptureFixture`, which accurately reflects that captured output is string data.
