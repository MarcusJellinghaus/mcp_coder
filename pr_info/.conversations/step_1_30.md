Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Issue Identified

I need to clarify the situation with you:

**Current Status:**
- The TASK_TRACKER.md shows Steps 1-8 are all marked as complete âœ…
- The file `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py` already exists and appears fully implemented
- Git status shows a clean working tree with no changes needed

**Your Request:**
You mentioned "Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions"

**My Question:**
I cannot find any uncompleted task in TASK_TRACKER.md that matches this description. Could you please clarify:

1. Is there a **different** `core.py` file that needs to be created (not the one in `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py`)?
2. Is there a **GitHub issue** number I should reference?
3. Should I look at a **different task tracker** or planning document?
4. Are we starting a **new feature** that's not yet documented in TASK_TRACKER.md?

Please let me know which task you'd like me to work on, and I'll implement it following all the CLAUDE.md requirements (using MCP tools, running all quality checks, etc.).
