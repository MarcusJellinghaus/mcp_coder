# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now I need to prepare a commit message. Let me read the requirements again to understand what the commit message should contain:

From the instructions:
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message

Let me prepare the commit message:

**Commit Message:**
```
test(coordinator): add test for no eligible issues case

Add test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues() to verify that
execute_coordinator_run handles the case when no eligible issues are
found, returning exit code 0 (success) without attempting to dispatch
any workflows.
```

Now let me verify that I've completed all the required steps:

✅ **STEP 1: SELECT TASK** - I identified the task: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues()`

✅ **STEP 2: IMPLEMENT** - I read the step file and implemented the test following the existing patterns

✅ **STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS** 
- ✅ Ran pylint - PASSED
- ✅ Ran pytest - PASSED (1103 tests)
- ✅ Ran mypy - PASSED

✅ **STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION** - All requirements met:
- Test written following TDD pattern
- Test verifies exit code 0 when no eligible issues found
- Test mocks all dependencies appropriately
- All code quality checks pass

✅ **STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** - Commit message prepared above

✅ **STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** - Updated TASK_TRACKER.md to mark the task as [x]

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the test `test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues()` in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`. 

**What was done:**
1. Added comprehensive test that verifies the behavior when `get_eligible_issues()` returns an empty list
2. Test confirms that the function returns exit code 0 (success, nothing to do)
3. Test verifies all setup steps occur correctly (config, credentials, managers)
4. Test ensures no workflows are dispatched when there are no eligible issues

**Code quality verification:**
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Pytest: All 1103 tests passed
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

**Commit message prepared:**
```
test(coordinator): add test for no eligible issues case

Add test_execute_coordinator_run_no_eligible_issues() to verify that
execute_coordinator_run handles the case when no eligible issues are
found, returning exit code 0 (success) without attempting to dispatch
any workflows.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
