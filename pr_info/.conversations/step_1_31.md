# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'`. This means **the package needs to be reinstalled** so that the new `create_pr` workflow package is available to the installed mcp-coder package.

This is a critical issue that must be resolved before I can run any tests. The package needs to be reinstalled using `pip install -e .` so that the new module structure is recognized. However, I cannot do this directly. I need to inform the user about this requirement.

Let me check if there's a standard way to handle this. Looking at Step 4 in the task tracker, it mentioned "requires package reinstall" for several validation tasks. Since this is a prerequisite for testing, I need to address this.

Let me inform the user about this blocker:

**CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**

I've encountered a critical issue that prevents me from completing Step 5 Part B (Comprehensive Testing).

**Problem:**  
The tests are failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'`

**Root Cause:**  
The package needs to be reinstalled for the new workflow package structure to be recognized by the installed mcp-coder package. The new files in `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/` were created in previous steps but are not yet available in the installed package.

**Required Action:**  
The package must be reinstalled in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Context:**  
- Step 4 noted "(requires package reinstall)" for validation tasks
- The new `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/` package was created in Step 2
- Without reinstalling, Python cannot import the new module structure
- All 5 test collectors and 9 integration tests are failing due to this import error

**Next Steps:**  
Once the package is reinstalled, I can proceed with:
1. Running all create_pr workflow tests
2. Running CLI command tests
3. Running integration tests
4. Running full test suite with parallel execution

Would you like me to wait while you reinstall the package, or should I document this requirement and mark this as a blocker?
