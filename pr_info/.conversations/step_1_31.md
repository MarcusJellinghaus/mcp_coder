Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **MCP SERVER ISSUE DETECTED** ðŸš¨

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md, this blocks all work until resolved. The `mcp__filesystem__read_file` tool is not available, which prevents me from:
- Reading the task tracker
- Reading test documentation
- Implementing any code changes

**Required MCP tools that should be available but are not:**
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__save_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`
- And other filesystem operations

Please verify that the MCP server is running and properly configured. I cannot proceed with the task until the MCP tools are accessible.
