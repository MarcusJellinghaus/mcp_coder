# Implementation Task: Verify .mcp.json configuration examples are correct

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify .mcp.json configuration examples are correct

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully.

## Summary

✅ **Task Complete: Verify .mcp.json configuration examples are correct**

**What was done:**
1. Located the .mcp.json configuration file
2. Identified an issue: command paths were using `${VIRTUAL_ENV}` instead of `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}`
3. Corrected the configuration to use `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` for both MCP server command paths
4. Verified the configuration now correctly uses:
   - `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` for runner environment references
   - `${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}` for project directory references
5. All code quality checks passed (pytest: 1022 tests, pylint: no issues, mypy: no type errors)

**Prepared commit message:**
```
docs(step4): fix .mcp.json to use MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR variable

Changed command paths from ${VIRTUAL_ENV} to ${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR} 
to align with architecture where MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR represents the 
runner environment. This ensures MCP servers use the correct Python 
environment when runner and project directories are separate.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
