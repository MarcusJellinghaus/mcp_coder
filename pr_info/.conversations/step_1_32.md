# Implementation Task: Update architecture documentation (if it exists)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update architecture documentation (if it exists)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been marked as complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Update architecture documentation (if it exists)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Done:

1. **Found Architecture Documentation**
   - Located `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (main architecture doc)
   - Located `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAINTENANCE.md` (maintenance guide)

2. **Updated ARCHITECTURE.md (Section 5 - Building Blocks)**
   - Added comprehensive design decision documentation for `llm/env.py`
   - Documented the architectural shift from filesystem detection to environment variables
   - Explained rationale: KISS principle using Python's built-in environment information (`VIRTUAL_ENV`, `CONDA_PREFIX`, `sys.prefix`)
   - Highlighted benefits: universal compatibility (venv/conda/system Python), ~90% less complexity, more reliable
   - Documented semantic change: `MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR` now points to runner environment (where mcp-coder executes), not project directory
   - Noted backward compatibility with both co-located and separate runner/project directories

3. **Updated Document Metadata**
   - Version: 1.6 → 1.7
   - Last Updated: 2025-10-08 → 2025-10-26

### Code Quality Verification:

✅ **Pylint**: No issues found  
✅ **Pytest**: 982 tests passed  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### All CLAUDE.md Requirements Followed:

✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)  
✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for verification  
✅ All code quality checks passed  
✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Next Task:** The next unchecked task in TASK_TRACKER.md is "Remove outdated venv requirement statements"
