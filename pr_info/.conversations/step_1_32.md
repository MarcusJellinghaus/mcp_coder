# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## üö® Package Reinstallation Required

I've identified a blocker for Step 5 Part B (Comprehensive Testing):

**Issue:** The tests cannot run because the new package structure (`mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr`) hasn't been installed yet.

**Evidence:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'
```

**What needs to happen:**

The package needs to be reinstalled with the new structure. Please run:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

**Why this is necessary:**

In Steps 1-4, we:
1. Created new package structure under `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`
2. Updated all import statements to use the new structure
3. Deleted legacy files

However, Python's import system still points to the old installed package. The reinstall will:
- Update Python's knowledge of the new package structure
- Make `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core` importable
- Allow all tests to find the new modules

**Once the package is reinstalled, I can complete:**
- ‚úÖ All create_pr workflow tests
- ‚úÖ CLI command tests  
- ‚úÖ Integration tests
- ‚úÖ Full test suite with parallel execution

Would you like me to wait while you run the reinstall command, or should I proceed with other tasks?
