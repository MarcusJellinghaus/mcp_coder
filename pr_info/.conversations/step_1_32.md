# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
**I need clarification:**

The TASK_TRACKER.md shows all 8 implementation steps are complete (code-wise), but several are missing commit messages. However, you mentioned: "Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions"

**This doesn't match what I see in the tracker.** Could you clarify:

1. Is there a different task tracker or project plan I should be looking at?
2. Are you referring to `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py` (which was already updated in Step 5)?
3. Or is this a new task not yet listed in TASK_TRACKER.md?

The next logical task based on TASK_TRACKER.md would be to prepare the missing commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8, or move to the Final Review and PR submission phase.

Please let me know which task you'd like me to work on.
