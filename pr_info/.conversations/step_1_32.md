## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! I've successfully completed Step 8. Let me provide a summary and the commit message:

## Summary

I've successfully implemented Step 8 - Integration Testing. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added `test_env_vars_propagation()` integration test** in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`:
   - Tests environment variable propagation through both CLI and API methods
   - Makes real Claude Code API calls to verify env_vars work end-to-end
   - Verifies successful execution means env_vars were properly prepared and passed

2. **Fixed mock objects** in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_llm_sessions.py`:
   - Updated `MockClaudeCLI.__call__()` to accept `env_vars` parameter
   - Updated `MockClaudeAPI.__call__()` to accept `env_vars` parameter
   - This ensures compatibility with the updated interface layer

### Verification:

✅ All claude_cli_integration tests passed (16/16)
✅ Pylint check passed - no issues found
✅ Mypy check passed - no type errors found
✅ Task tracker updated to mark Step 8 as complete

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.

```
test: add integration test for env_vars propagation (step_8)

Add test_env_vars_propagation() integration test to verify environment
variables propagate correctly through both CLI and API methods with
real Claude Code calls.

Also update mock objects in test_llm_sessions.py to accept env_vars
parameter for compatibility with updated interface layer.
