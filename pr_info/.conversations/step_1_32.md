# Implementation Task: Fix config path bug in workflows/define_labels.py line 290

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Fix config path bug in workflows/define_labels.py line 290

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been successfully completed and marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md.

## Summary

✅ **TASK COMPLETED**: Fix config path bug in workflows/define_labels.py line 290

**What was done:**
1. Fixed the critical bug by removing `.parent` from the config path construction
2. Changed line 289 from `project_dir.parent / "workflows" / "config" / "labels.json"` to `project_dir / "workflows" / "config" / "labels.json"`
3. Verified all tests pass (25 tests in test_define_labels.py)
4. Confirmed mypy type checking passes with no errors
5. Confirmed no new pylint issues introduced in define_labels.py
6. Marked the task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Commit message prepared:**
```
fix(workflows): remove incorrect .parent in define_labels.py config path

Fixed critical bug in workflows/define_labels.py line 289 where config_path
was incorrectly using project_dir.parent instead of project_dir, causing
the script to look for labels.json in the wrong directory.

Changed from: project_dir.parent / "workflows" / "config" / "labels.json"
Changed to:   project_dir / "workflows" / "config" / "labels.json"
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**: Used MCP tools exclusively, ran code quality checks, and ensured all requirements were met.
