## Summary

✅ **Task completed successfully!**

### Implementation Details

I successfully added environment preparation to `generate_commit_message_with_llm()` in `src/mcp_coder/utils/commit_operations.py`:

**Changes made:**
1. ✅ Added import: `from ..llm.env import prepare_llm_environment`
2. ✅ Added env_vars preparation early in function: `env_vars = prepare_llm_environment(project_dir)`
3. ✅ Passed env_vars to ask_llm() call with parameter: `env_vars=env_vars`
4. ✅ Updated all 17 test methods in `tests/utils/test_commit_operations.py` to mock `prepare_llm_environment`
5. ✅ Verified env_vars propagation in test assertions

**Code Quality Results:**
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 26 tests passed (17 in TestGenerateCommitMessageWithLLM + 9 in TestParseLLMCommitResponse)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**
