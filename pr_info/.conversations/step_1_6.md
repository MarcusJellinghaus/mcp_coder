# Implementation Task: Update create_issue() to populate assignees

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update create_issue() to populate assignees

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Now let me prepare the commit message for Step 3:

## Commit Message:

```
test(github): add assignees field to all IssueData test mocks

Update test mocks in test_issue_manager.py to include the assignees 
field for all methods that return IssueData. This ensures test mocks 
match the complete TypedDict structure.

Methods with updated test mocks:
- create_issue() - 2 test mocks updated
- close_issue() - 1 test mock updated
- reopen_issue() - 1 test mock updated
- add_labels() - 2 test mocks updated
- remove_labels() - 2 test mocks updated
- set_labels() - 3 test mocks updated

All implementation methods already had assignees populated from GitHub 
API responses. This commit only updates test mocks to match.

All code quality checks pass:
- Pylint: No issues
- Pytest: All updated tests passing
- Mypy: No type errors
```

## Task Completion Summary:

✅ **Step 3 Complete**: Updated all existing methods to populate assignees field

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Verified all 6 methods (create_issue, close_issue, reopen_issue, add_labels, remove_labels, set_labels) already populate assignees from GitHub API
2. ✅ Updated 11 test mocks to include `assignees=[]` field
3. ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
4. ✅ Prepared git commit message
5. ✅ Marked task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Note:** The implementation methods already had the assignees field populated correctly. The work involved updating test mocks to match the complete IssueData TypedDict structure.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools exclusively
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
