# Implementation Task: Create src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/implement.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/implement.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I have successfully implemented Step 5 of the task tracker. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Summary

✅ **Step 5: Implement CLI Command Interface with Tests - COMPLETED**

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/implement.py`** with:
   - `execute_implement()` function that accepts parsed CLI arguments 
   - Proper error handling for KeyboardInterrupt and general exceptions
   - Integration with existing workflow core modules (`resolve_project_dir`, `run_implement_workflow`)

2. **Updated `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/__init__.py`** to:
   - Import the new `execute_implement` function
   - Export it in the `__all__` list

3. **Updated `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py`** to:
   - Import `execute_implement` from commands module
   - Add implement subparser with `--project-dir` and `--llm-method` arguments  
   - Add routing logic to call `execute_implement()` when implement command is used

4. **Fixed failing tests** that expected implement command to not exist:
   - Updated test to verify implement command IS implemented
   - Fixed unused type ignore comment
   - Enhanced test coverage for error scenarios

5. **Verified code quality** with all MCP tools:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors  
   - ✅ Pytest: All 9 relevant tests passing, 4 integration tests appropriately skipped

The implement CLI command is now fully functional and ready for use. Users can run:
- `mcp-coder implement` (uses current directory, claude_code_api)
- `mcp-coder implement --project-dir /path/to/project --llm-method claude_code_cli`

**Commit message:** `feat(cli): implement CLI command interface for workflow execution`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
