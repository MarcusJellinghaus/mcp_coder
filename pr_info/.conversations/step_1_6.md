## LLM Response:
The working tree is clean - all changes have been committed. 

**Clarification needed:** You mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" but:

1. The task tracker shows all implementation steps are complete
2. There are no uncommitted changes
3. This specific task doesn't appear in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Question:** Could you clarify which task you want me to work on? The options are:
