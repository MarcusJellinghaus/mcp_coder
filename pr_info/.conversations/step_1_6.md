# Implementation Task: Extend `tests/cli/test_main.py` with coordinator CLI tests (see step_4.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Extend `tests/cli/test_main.py` with coordinator CLI tests (see step_4.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need approval for bash commands. Let me ask the user for clarification on this setup issue:

I've encountered a configuration issue. The tests are failing because pytest is importing from the **production** directory (`local-windows/mcp_coder_prod/`) instead of the current development directory (`local-windows/targets/mcp_coder/`) where I made the changes.

The test errors show:
```
'C:\\Users\\Marcus\\Documents\\GitHub\\AutoRunner\\local-windows\\mcp_coder_prod\\src\\mcp_coder\\cli\\main.py'
```

But I modified the files in:
```
C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\targets\mcp_coder\src\mcp_coder\cli\main.py
```

**The changes I've successfully made:**
1. ✅ Added `TestCoordinatorCommand` class with 5 tests to `tests/cli/test_main.py`  
2. ✅ Added `execute_coordinator_test` import to `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py`
3. ✅ Added coordinator subparser to `create_parser()` in `main.py`
4. ✅ Added coordinator routing to `main()` function
5. ✅ Pylint: PASSED
6. ✅ Mypy: PASSED  
7. ❌ Pytest: FAILED (importing from wrong directory)

**Question:** Should I:
1. Copy my changes to the `mcp_coder_prod` directory for testing?
2. Reconfigure the MCP code checker to use the local source?
3. Install the package in editable mode in a local venv?
4. Something else?

Please advise on the correct approach for this development environment setup.
