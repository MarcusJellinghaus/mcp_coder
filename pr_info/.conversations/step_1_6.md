# Implementation Task: Create tests/workflows/config/test_labels.json test fixture

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create tests/workflows/config/test_labels.json test fixture

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I understand the issue now. According to CLAUDE.md, I must use MCP filesystem tools, but the save_file tool seems to have a bug. Let me check if there's an issue with how I'm calling it. Let me look at how other files use this tool or check if there's a write method:

Looking at the available MCP tools, I see `mcp__filesystem__save_file` which I've been trying to use. The error message says "Content must be a string, got <class 'dict'>" but I'm passing a string. This suggests the MCP server might be parsing JSON automatically. 

Let me ask the user for approval to proceed with the standard approach since the MCP tool appears to have an issue:

I'm encountering an issue with the `mcp__filesystem__save_file` tool - it's rejecting valid JSON string content with an error "Content must be a string, got <class 'dict'>". This appears to be a bug in the MCP filesystem server where it's auto-parsing JSON content.

Since the CLAUDE.md instructions require using MCP tools but this tool is not functioning correctly for JSON files, I need to:

1. Either get approval to use the standard `Write` tool for this JSON file creation, OR
2. Get approval to use a Bash command to create the file

The file I need to create is a simple JSON test fixture at `tests/workflows/config/test_labels.json` with 4 minimal label entries for testing purposes.

Which approach would you prefer, or would you like me to investigate the MCP tool issue further?
