Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement apply_labels() orchestrator with dry_run support

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Let me provide a summary and commit message. All CLAUDE.md requirements have been followed.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `apply_labels()` orchestrator function with comprehensive test coverage. Here's what was completed:

### Implementation (`workflows/define_labels.py`)
✅ Added `apply_labels()` orchestrator function with:
- Dry-run mode support (preview changes without applying)
- INFO level logging for all actions (Created/Updated/Deleted)
- Idempotency (skips API calls for unchanged labels)
- Strict deletion of obsolete `status-*` labels only
- Fail-fast error handling (exits on first API error with code 1)
- Integration with `LabelsManager` for GitHub API operations

### Tests (`tests/workflows/test_define_labels.py`)
✅ Added 3 integration tests with mocked `LabelsManager`:
1. **Success flow** - Tests create, update, and delete operations
2. **Dry-run mode** - Verifies no API write calls in preview mode
3. **API error fail-fast** - Confirms immediate exit on first error

✅ Added pytest fixture `mock_labels_manager` for testing

### Quality Checks
✅ **Pytest**: All 29 tests pass (including 8 calculate_label_changes + 3 apply_labels tests)
✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
✅ **Mypy**: No issues in define_labels.py (pre-existing issues in other files)

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed
✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code checks
✅ Used fast unit tests without slow integration markers
✅ All code quality checks pass
