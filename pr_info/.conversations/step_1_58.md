# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_issue_with_multiple_bot_pickup_labels()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_issue_with_multiple_bot_pickup_labels()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully implemented the task `test_issue_with_multiple_bot_pickup_labels()`. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Implementation Complete

**Test Added:** `test_issue_with_multiple_bot_pickup_labels()` in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`

**Test Functionality:**
- Tests the edge case where issues have multiple bot_pickup labels (misconfiguration)
- Verifies that such issues are correctly filtered out by `get_eligible_issues()`
- Confirms that properly configured issues (exactly one bot_pickup label) are still processed
- Validates that the coordinator continues normally, dispatching workflows only for valid issues
- Checks that correct workflows are dispatched in priority order (issue 103 with status-08 before issue 101 with status-02)
- Verifies correct label transitions for valid issues only
- Confirms exit code 0 (success)

**Test Scenario:**
- 3 issues: 
  - Issue #101: valid (status-02:awaiting-planning) → processed ✅
  - Issue #102: misconfigured (both status-02 AND status-05) → skipped ❌
  - Issue #103: valid (status-08:ready-pr) → processed ✅
- Result: 2 Jenkins jobs triggered, 2 label updates, exit code 0

### ✅ Code Quality Checks - All Passed
- **Pylint:** No issues
- **Pytest:** All 1121 tests passed (fast unit tests)
- **Mypy:** No type errors

### ✅ Commit Message Prepared
```
test(coordinator): add multiple bot_pickup labels edge case test

Add test_issue_with_multiple_bot_pickup_labels() to verify that:
- Issues with multiple bot_pickup labels are filtered out
- Only properly configured issues (exactly one bot_pickup label) are processed
- Coordinator continues normally with valid issues
- Correct workflows dispatched and labels updated for valid issues only
```

### ✅ Task Marked Complete
The task checkbox in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` has been updated from `[ ]` to `[x]`.

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
