## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **MCP TOOLS NOT ACCESSIBLE** - This blocks all work until resolved.

The MCP filesystem tools specified in CLAUDE.md are not available. I cannot proceed with this task as I'm required to use MCP tools exclusively for file operations.

**Required MCP tools that are missing:**
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__save_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`

**Please verify:**
1. Is the MCP server running?
2. Are the MCP tools properly configured?
3. Should I proceed with standard Claude tools instead?

I need your guidance on how to proceed given that the mandatory MCP filesystem tools are not accessible.
