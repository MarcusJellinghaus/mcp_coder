# Implementation Task: Implement get_pull_request with structured dict return

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement get_pull_request with structured dict return

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the `get_pull_request` task. Let me start by examining the task tracker and understanding what needs to be done.Now I can see that the current task is to **implement `get_pull_request` with structured dict return** as part of Step 4. Let me examine the current PullRequestManager implementation to understand what needs to be done.Now let me check the test file to understand what the expected structure should be for the `get_pull_request` method:Now I understand what needs to be implemented. Looking at the test, the `get_pull_request` method should return a structured dictionary with PR information similar to what `create_pull_request` returns. Let me implement it:Perfect! I've implemented the `get_pull_request` method with structured dict return. Now let me run the required code quality checks as specified in CLAUDE.md:The pytest check timed out. Let me check the tests/readme.md to understand which tests I should run for this context, as suggested:Let me check what the current todo status is and update it appropriately:Now let me run just the unit tests without the slow integration tests, since the pytest command timed out before:Great! The unit tests are passing. Now let me check the specific GitHub integration tests to make sure my implementation works correctly:The GitHub integration tests are being skipped, which is expected since they require GitHub token and repository configuration that's not set up in this environment. This is the correct behavior based on the test design.

Let me update the todo status and check if the task is completed according to the TASK_TRACKER.md:Let me check the TASK_TRACKER.md again to confirm the task is complete and mark it as done:Now I need to mark the specific task as completed in the TASK_TRACKER.md. I can see that "Implement get_pull_request with structured dict return" is currently unchecked in Step 4. Let me update it:Perfect! I have successfully completed the task **"Implement get_pull_request with structured dict return"**. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Implementation Summary

**Current task completed:** Implement `get_pull_request` with structured dict return

### What was implemented:
- Added full implementation to the `get_pull_request` method in `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/pr_manager.py:126-158`
- The method now retrieves pull request information using the GitHub API via `repo.get_pull(pr_number)`
- Returns a structured dictionary with the same format as `create_pull_request`:
  - `number`, `title`, `body`, `state`
  - `head_branch`, `base_branch`, `url`  
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`, `user`
  - `mergeable`, `merged`, `draft`
- Includes proper error handling that returns empty dict on failures
- Uses the same exception handling pattern as other methods

### Code quality verification:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found  
- ✅ **Pytest**: 400 unit tests passed (GitHub integration tests correctly skipped due to missing config)

### Task tracking:
- ✅ Task marked as completed in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**Suggested commit message:** `feat(github): implement get_pull_request with structured dict return`

The implementation follows the established patterns and is ready for the next task in the sequence.
