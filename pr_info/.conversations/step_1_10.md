Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update __init__.py to export IssueManager

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Complete

**Step 9: Integration and Module Export** has been successfully implemented.

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Updated `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/__init__.py` to import and export `IssueManager`, `IssueData`, `CommentData`, and `LabelData`
2. ✅ Updated `src/mcp_coder/__init__.py` to re-export these classes for public API access

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 49 IssueManager unit tests pass

### Note:
Some pre-existing test failures in `test_claude_code_api_error_handling.py` are unrelated to these changes (they test Claude CLI error messages).

### Commit Message:
```

- Add IssueManager, IssueData, CommentData, LabelData to github_operations __init__.py
- Export GitHub operations types from main package __init__.py
