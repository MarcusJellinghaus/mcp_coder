## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: MCP Server Issues**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md, this blocks all work until resolved. The required tool `mcp__filesystem__read_file` is not available.

**Required Action:** Please check and restart the MCP server to enable the required tools:
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__save_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`
- And other filesystem MCP tools

I cannot proceed with the task until the MCP tools are available as per the mandatory project requirements.
