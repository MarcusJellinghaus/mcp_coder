# Implementation Task: Create tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py skeleton

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py skeleton

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Both checkboxes are now marked as complete:
- ✅ `- [x] Create tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py skeleton` (main task)
- ✅ `- [x] Prepare git commit message for label configuration setup` (commit message task)

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task **"Create tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py skeleton"**:

### What was implemented:
1. Created `tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py` with three skeleton test functions:
   - `test_load_labels_json()` - Will validate labels.json loading
   - `test_labels_json_schema_valid()` - Will validate label schema structure
   - `test_category_values_valid()` - Will validate category values

2. Each test is marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` as placeholders for Step 3 implementation

3. All code quality checks passed:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Pytest: 3 tests collected, 3 skipped (as expected)
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

### Commit message prepared:
```
test: add test_issue_stats.py skeleton for Step 3

Created tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py with three placeholder test
functions that will be implemented in Step 3:
- test_load_labels_json() - validate labels.json loading
- test_labels_json_schema_valid() - validate label schema
- test_category_values_valid() - validate category values

Tests are marked with @pytest.mark.skip as issue_stats.py doesn't exist yet.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:** Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively, ran all code quality checks using MCP tools, and verified all checks passed.
