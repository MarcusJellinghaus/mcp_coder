# Implementation Task: Add Import Statement

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add Import Statement

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task. Let me verify the final state and provide a summary:

## Task Completion Summary

### ✅ STEP 1: SELECT TASK
**Selected Task:** Add Import Statement - Import `execute_create_pr` in `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py`

### ✅ STEP 2: IMPLEMENT
**Changes Made:**
- Added import statement at line 8 of `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py`:
  ```python
  from .commands.create_pr import execute_create_pr
  ```
- Import was added in alphabetical order with other command imports (after `commit`, before `help`)

### ✅ STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS
All three mandatory code quality checks passed:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
- ✅ **Pytest**: 973 tests passed, 15 skipped

### ✅ STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION
**Requirements Verified:**
- ✅ Import statement added to `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py` at line 8
- ✅ Import follows correct module path: `.commands.create_pr`
- ✅ Import placed alphabetically with other command imports
- ✅ All code quality checks pass

### ✅ STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE
**Prepared Commit Message:**
```
feat(cli): add create_pr import to main CLI entry point

Import execute_create_pr function from commands.create_pr module to prepare for
Step 3 integration of the create-pr subcommand.

Part of Issue #139 - Convert create_PR workflow to CLI command
```

### ✅ STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE
**Task Tracker Updated:**
- Changed `- [ ] Add Import Statement` to `- [x] Add Import Statement`
- Changed nested checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` for the import task
- File: `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` (lines 65-66)

---

## All CLAUDE.md Requirements Followed

✅ Used MCP filesystem tools (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)  
✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks  
✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)  
✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md  
✅ No standard tools used when MCP alternatives existed  

**The task is now complete and ready for the next step in the workflow!**
