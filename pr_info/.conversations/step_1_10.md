# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The `py.typed` marker is at the right level. The issue is that when a package is installed in editable mode, sometimes Python's import system doesn't pick up newly added submodules until the package is reinstalled.

**The issue is clear:** The new `jenkins_operations` module was added to the source tree, but the Python environment doesn't know about it yet because:
1. The package is installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
2. New subpackages require Python to update its import cache

**Solution:** We need to reinstall the package. However, since the Bash command requires approval, let me ask the user to run this command:

I've identified the issue with the tests. The `mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations` module cannot be imported because the package was installed in editable mode and Python hasn't picked up the new submodule yet.

**Issue:** The files exist and are correct, but Python's import system needs to be refreshed.

**Required Action:** Please run the following command to reinstall the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will update Python's import cache to recognize the new `jenkins_operations` submodule.

**What I've verified so far:**
- ✅ Test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` exists with all 9 TDD tests
- ✅ Source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` exists with `JobStatus` and `QueueSummary` dataclasses
- ✅ Both `__init__.py` files exist for the test and source directories
- ✅ All code follows the specifications from step_1.md

**After you run the reinstall command, I'll continue with the code quality checks.**

Would you like me to proceed after you've run the command, or would you prefer to run it yourself and then let me know?
