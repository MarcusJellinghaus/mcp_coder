# Implementation Task: Create integration test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_integration.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create integration test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me provide a summary of what was completed:

## ✅ Step 3 Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the integration tests for Jenkins operations. Here's what was accomplished:

### Files Created:
1. **tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_integration.py** (~170 lines)
   - Integration tests that work with a real Jenkins server
   - Gracefully skips when Jenkins is not configured
   - Two test methods: `test_basic_api_connectivity` and `test_job_lifecycle`

### Files Modified:
1. **pyproject.toml**
   - Added `jenkins_integration` pytest marker
   - Added mypy override for `jenkins` module to ignore missing type stubs

2. **tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_client.py**
   - Fixed unused `type: ignore` comments (changed to `pyright: ignore`)

### Key Features Implemented:
- **jenkins_test_setup** fixture: Provides configuration with priority (env vars > config file)
- **jenkins_client** fixture: Creates authenticated Jenkins client
- **test_basic_api_connectivity**: Verifies Jenkins API connection works
- **test_job_lifecycle**: Starts a job and verifies status tracking works
- Tests skip with helpful message when Jenkins not configured

### Code Quality:
✅ **Pylint**: No errors  
✅ **Pytest**: 1012 tests pass (including 2 new integration tests that skip gracefully)  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors  

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
test(jenkins): add integration tests with real Jenkins server

- Create test_integration.py with fixtures for Jenkins configuration
- Add jenkins_test_setup fixture with env var and config file support
- Implement test_basic_api_connectivity and test_job_lifecycle tests
- Tests skip gracefully when Jenkins not configured
- Add jenkins_integration pytest marker to pyproject.toml
- Add mypy override for jenkins module to ignore missing type stubs
- Fix unused type:ignore comments in test_client.py
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** ✅

**Next Step:** The next task in the tracker is Step 4 - Module Exports and Public API setup.
