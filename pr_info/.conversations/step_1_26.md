# Implementation Task: Run mypy on src and tests directories

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Run mypy on src and tests directories

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ **Task completed successfully!**

## Summary

I've successfully completed the task "Run mypy on src and tests directories":

### What was done:
1. ✅ **Ran mypy type checking** using `mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check` on both `src` and `tests` directories
2. ✅ **Result**: No type errors found - all type annotations are correct
3. ✅ **Marked task complete** in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` by changing the checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`

### Verification:
- Mypy completed successfully with zero type errors
- No fixes were needed
- The task is now marked as complete in the tracker

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP tool (`mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check`) exclusively for mypy checks
- ✅ No standard Bash tools used for code quality checks
- ✅ Task tracker properly updated
- ✅ All code quality checks passed

The next task in the tracker is "Fix all mypy issues" which is already complete since no issues were found, followed by "Run full test suite (all tests including integration)".
