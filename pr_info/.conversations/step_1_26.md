Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL MCP SERVER ISSUE**: MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. This blocks all work according to CLAUDE.md requirements.

The MCP server appears to be unavailable - I cannot access the required `mcp__filesystem__*` tools that are mandatory for this project. These tools should be available for:
- Reading files (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`)
- Writing files (`mcp__filesystem__save_file`)
- Editing files (`mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)
- And other file operations

**This must be resolved before I can proceed with the task.**

Could you please:
1. Check if the MCP server is running
2. Verify the MCP configuration in `.mcp.json`
3. Restart the MCP server if needed

Once the MCP tools are accessible, I can begin implementing the core.py task.
