# Implementation Task: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see that the file wasn't edited because I didn't have write permissions granted yet. The user needs to grant permission for the edit to be applied. Let me wait for that and provide a clear message about what needs to happen.

**Working on Step 8: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`**

## Status

I've prepared the integration test implementation but need write permission to add it to the file. The test will:

1. **Test CLI method**: Verify environment variables work with CLI-based Claude Code execution
2. **Test API method**: Verify environment variables work with API-based Claude Code execution  
3. **Simple validation**: Successful execution means env_vars were correctly prepared and propagated

The test follows the same pattern as existing integration tests in the file - it makes real API calls and verifies basic functionality.

## Issues Found

While preparing to test, I discovered that `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_llm_sessions.py` has 10 failing tests due to `MockClaudeCLI` not accepting the `env_vars` parameter that was added in previous steps. However, based on the task scope in TASK_TRACKER.md, I should only focus on adding the integration test to `test_claude_integration.py`.

**Question**: Should I also fix the failing tests in `test_llm_sessions.py` by updating the mock to accept `env_vars`, or should I stick to only implementing the task as specified in Step 8?

Please grant write permission so I can add the test to the file.
