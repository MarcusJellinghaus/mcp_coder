# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_fail_fast_on_jenkins_error()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_end_to_end_fail_fast_on_jenkins_error()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completed Successfully ✅

I have successfully implemented the test `test_end_to_end_fail_fast_on_jenkins_error()` as specified in the task tracker.

### What Was Implemented:

**Test Location:** `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:3216-3414`

**Test Purpose:** Verifies fail-fast behavior when Jenkins job fails to start during coordinator run.

**Test Scenario:**
1. Three eligible issues are queued for processing
2. First issue (#201) dispatches successfully (status-08:ready-pr → status-09:pr-creating)
3. Second issue (#202) triggers a `JenkinsError` when attempting to start the Jenkins job
4. Processing stops immediately (fail-fast behavior)
5. Third issue (#203) is never processed
6. Function returns exit code 1 (error)

**Key Verifications:**
- Only 2 Jenkins jobs attempted (first succeeded, second failed)
- Job status checked only once (for the successful first job)
- Only the first issue had its labels updated
- The second issue failed before label update
- The third issue was never reached due to fail-fast
- Exit code 1 returned to indicate error

### Code Quality Checks: All Passed ✅

1. **Pylint:** No issues found
2. **Pytest:** All 1116 fast unit tests pass (including the new test)
3. **Mypy:** No type errors found

### Task Tracker Updated:

The checkbox in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` has been changed from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for this task.

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- All checks passed before completion
- Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
