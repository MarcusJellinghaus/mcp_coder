# Implementation Task: Fix path separator in `.mcp.json` line 25 (backslash → forward slash)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Fix path separator in `.mcp.json` line 25 (backslash → forward slash)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! All tasks for Step 8 are now marked as complete. Now I have completed the task as required. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Fix path separator in `.mcp.json` line 25 (backslash → forward slash)

### What I Did:

1. **Fixed the path separator** in `.mcp.json` line 25:
   - Changed: `"${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}\\Scripts\\mcp-server-filesystem.exe"`
   - To: `"${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}/Scripts/mcp-server-filesystem.exe"`
   - This ensures cross-platform compatibility as forward slashes work on all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)

2. **Verified no breakage** by running all required tests:
   - ✅ All coordinator tests passed (53 tests)
   - ✅ All CLI tests passed (28 tests)
   - ✅ All fast unit tests passed (1121 tests)

3. **Updated the task tracker** to mark all Step 8 subtasks as complete:
   - ✅ Fix path separator task
   - ✅ Run coordinator tests
   - ✅ Run CLI tests
   - ✅ Run fast unit tests
   - ✅ Verify no functional changes
   - ✅ Prepare git commit message

### Commit Message (Prepared):

```
fix(.mcp.json): use forward slashes for cross-platform path compatibility

Replace backslash path separator with forward slash in filesystem MCP 
server command path for consistent cross-platform behavior.
```

### Verification:
- All code quality checks pass
- No functional changes - configuration improvement only
- All CLAUDE.md requirements followed
- MCP filesystem tools used exclusively for file operations

The task has been successfully completed. All Step 8 tasks are now marked as complete in the task tracker.
