# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary of Current Status

### ✅ COMPLETED:
1. **Test file exists**: `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with 9 comprehensive tests
2. **Models file exists**: `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` with JobStatus and QueueSummary dataclasses
3. **Init files exist**: Both `__init__.py` files are in place
4. **Mypy check PASSED**: No type errors found
5. **Pylint check PASSED**: No issues found

### ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION:
The **pytest tests cannot run** until the package is reinstalled because the new `jenkins_operations` module needs to be available in the Python environment.

**Required command** (needs approval):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or run the batch script:
```bash
tools\reinstall.bat
```

### Why is this needed?
The new module `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/` was created but the package wasn't reinstalled in editable mode. When pytest tries to import `from mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations.models import ...`, Python can't find it because it's not registered in the installed package metadata.

### After Reinstall:
Once you run `pip install -e .`, all 9 tests in `test_models.py` should pass based on the implementation:
- test_job_status_creation
- test_job_status_str_queued
- test_job_status_str_running
- test_job_status_str_completed
- test_job_status_str_completed_failure
- test_queue_summary_creation
- test_queue_summary_str_multiple
- test_queue_summary_str_singular
- test_queue_summary_str_empty

Would you like me to wait for you to run the reinstall, or should I proceed to prepare the commit message assuming the tests will pass after reinstall?
