# Implementation Task: Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_empty_virtual_env`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_empty_virtual_env`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete. Let me now create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Complete ✅

**Task:** Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_empty_virtual_env`

### What Was Implemented:
1. **Added new test** `test_prepare_llm_environment_empty_virtual_env` to `tests/llm/test_env.py`
   - Tests that empty/whitespace-only VIRTUAL_ENV falls back to CONDA_PREFIX
   - Uses monkeypatch for clean environment variable handling
   - Follows existing test patterns and structure
   - Located at tests/llm/test_env.py:80-100

### Verification Results:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 1023 tests pass (including the new test)
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
test: add test_prepare_llm_environment_empty_virtual_env

Add test to verify that empty/whitespace-only VIRTUAL_ENV environment
variable falls back to CONDA_PREFIX. This test ensures the validation
logic properly handles empty strings (whitespace stripped) and continues
to the next environment source in the priority chain.
```

### Task Status:
- ✅ Main implementation task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
- ✅ All CLAUDE.md requirements followed (used MCP tools exclusively)
- ✅ Ready for next task in the workflow
