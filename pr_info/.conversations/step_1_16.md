# Implementation Task: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need permission to edit the test file. Let me wait for permission and then continue.

Once I have permission, I'll:
1. Add the `test_env_vars_propagation()` integration test
2. Run the tests
3. Run code quality checks
4. Update the task tracker

The test implementation follows the specification in step_8.md:
- Tests both CLI and API methods
- Makes real Claude Code calls to verify env_vars work end-to-end
- Verifies successful execution (which means env vars are accessible to MCP servers)

Working on: **Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`**
