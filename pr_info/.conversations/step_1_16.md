# Implementation Task: Create workflows/issue_stats.bat batch launcher

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create workflows/issue_stats.bat batch launcher

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

I've successfully implemented the **workflows/issue_stats.bat batch launcher** following the exact pattern from define_labels.bat.

### What was created:
- **workflows/issue_stats.bat** - Windows batch launcher with:
  - UTF-8 encoding setup (chcp 65001, PYTHONIOENCODING, PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING, PYTHONUTF8)
  - PYTHONPATH configuration to include src directory
  - Argument pass-through for all flags (--filter, --details, --ignore-labels, etc.)
  - Error propagation with ERRORLEVEL checking
  - Success/failure messages

### Code Quality Verification:
✅ **Pylint**: No issues found  
✅ **Pytest**: 984 tests passed, 4 skipped (fast unit tests only)  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
feat(workflows): add issue_stats.bat batch launcher

Create Windows batch launcher for issue statistics workflow following
the same pattern as define_labels.bat. Includes UTF-8 encoding setup,
PYTHONPATH configuration, and proper error handling.

Supports all issue_stats.py flags: --filter, --details, --ignore-labels
```

### Status:
- Task marked as complete in pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md ✅
- All CLAUDE.md requirements followed ✅
- Ready for the next task in the workflow ✅

The batch launcher can now be used to run the issue statistics workflow from the command line with all the supported options!
