# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
There's a pyproject.toml. The issue is clear - the tests are running against an older installed version of the package located in `mcp_coder_prod`, not the current source code. According to the CLAUDE.md instructions, there's a `local-windows/setup/reinstall_coder.bat` script that should be used to reinstall.

Let me provide a clear explanation to the user about what needs to be done:

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**

The tests are failing because they're running against an outdated installation of `mcp-coder` located at:
```
C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod\
```

This installation doesn't have the new code from Steps 1-5 (coordinator functionality, user_config updates, etc.).

**SOLUTION:**

You need to reinstall the mcp-coder package from the current source code. According to your project structure, you should run:

```bash
local-windows\setup\reinstall_coder.bat
```

This will:
1. Update the `mcp_coder_prod` installation with the latest code from `local-windows/targets/mcp_coder`
2. Ensure all new modules (coordinator.py, user_config updates) are available for import
3. Allow tests to run against the updated code

**After reinstalling**, we can re-run the code quality checks and they should pass.

Would you like me to wait while you run the reinstall script, or would you prefer a different approach?
