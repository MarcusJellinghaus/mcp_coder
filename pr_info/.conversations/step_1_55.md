# Implementation Task: Remove hardcoded label fallback in process_issues()

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Remove hardcoded label fallback in process_issues()

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been successfully marked as complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Summary

I successfully implemented the task: **Remove hardcoded label fallback in process_issues()**

### Changes Made

**File:** `workflows/validate_labels.py` (line 277)

**Before:**
```python
created_label_name = id_to_name.get("created", "status-01:created")
```

**After:**
```python
created_label_name = id_to_name["created"]
```

### Rationale

The change replaces the fallback mechanism with direct dictionary access. This provides:
- **Better error detection**: Raises `KeyError` if "created" label is missing from configuration
- **Clear failure diagnostics**: Shows exactly what's wrong instead of silently using a potentially incorrect hardcoded value
- **Configuration integrity**: Ensures the configuration file is the single source of truth

### Verification

✅ **All code quality checks passed:**
- Pylint: No issues found
- Mypy: No type errors found  
- Pytest: All 287 workflow tests passed

✅ **Task marked complete** in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Prepared Commit Message

```
refactor(validate_labels): remove hardcoded label fallback in process_issues

Replace fallback dict.get() with direct dict access for 'created' label to ensure clear error if label is missing from configuration. This provides better failure diagnostics instead of silent fallback to potentially incorrect label name.

Changed:
- id_to_name.get("created", "status-01:created") → id_to_name["created"]
- Will now raise KeyError if "created" label missing from config
```

### All CLAUDE.md Requirements Followed

✅ Used MCP tools for all operations  
✅ Ran all three code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)  
✅ All checks passed with no issues  
✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md  

The implementation is complete and ready for the next task in the workflow.
