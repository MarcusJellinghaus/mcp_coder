# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_log_level_pass_through()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_end_to_end_log_level_pass_through()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task is now marked as complete. Let me provide a final summary:

## Task Completed Successfully

I have successfully implemented the test `test_end_to_end_log_level_pass_through()` as requested.

### What was implemented:

**Test added:** `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py::TestCoordinatorRunIntegration::test_end_to_end_log_level_pass_through()`

**Test verifies:**
1. ✅ The `--log-level DEBUG` argument is correctly passed from coordinator run to the workflow commands
2. ✅ The log level is properly formatted into the Jenkins job COMMAND parameter
3. ✅ The command contains `--log-level debug` (lowercase as per the template format)
4. ✅ The workflow executes successfully with proper label transitions

### Code Quality Checks - ALL PASSED:
- ✅ **Pytest:** 1118/1118 tests passed (including the new test)
- ✅ **Pylint:** No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy:** No type errors found

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
test: add end-to-end log level pass-through test

Add test_end_to_end_log_level_pass_through() to verify that the
--log-level argument is correctly passed from coordinator run
to the mcp-coder workflow commands in Jenkins job parameters.
```

### Task Tracker Updated:
- ✅ Main task marked complete: `- [x] Write test: test_end_to_end_log_level_pass_through()`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- Used MCP code-checker tools for all code quality checks
- All three checks (pylint, pytest, mypy) passed
- Task properly marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The implementation is complete and ready for the next task in the workflow.
