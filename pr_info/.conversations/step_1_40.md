# Implementation Task: Update pyproject.toml to keep only W1203 and W0621 in global disables

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update pyproject.toml to keep only W1203 and W0621 in global disables

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now let me verify all CLAUDE.md requirements were followed and provide a summary:

## Summary

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**

✅ **Used MCP tools exclusively:**
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Read files
- `mcp__filesystem__edit_file` - Edit files  
- `mcp__code-checker__run_pylint_check` - Pylint verification
- `mcp__code-checker__run_pytest_check` - Test verification
- `mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check` - Type check verification

✅ **All code quality checks passed:**
- Pylint: Clean (no issues found)
- Pytest: All 1022 tests passed
- Mypy: No type errors

✅ **Task completed successfully:**

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK** ✅
- Selected: "Update pyproject.toml to keep only W1203 and W0621 in global disables"

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT** ✅
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to keep only W1203 and W0621 in global disables
- Removed 9 overly broad global disables: W0511, W0613, W0246, W0612, W0706, W0719, W0404, W0718, W0707
- Simplified comments for remaining disables

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS** ✅
- Pylint: Clean (no new warnings generated - excellent outcome!)
- Pytest: All 1022 tests pass
- Mypy: No type errors

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION** ✅
- All requirements from step_6.md met
- No inline disables needed (code already follows best practices)
- All subtasks in TASK_TRACKER.md marked complete

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ✅
```
refactor(step6): remove overly broad pylint global disables from pyproject.toml

Keep only W1203 (lazy % formatting) and W0621 (redefined-outer-name for pytest
fixtures) as global pylint disables. Remove W0511, W0613, W0246, W0612, W0706,
W0719, W0404, W0718, W0707 from global configuration.

All code quality checks pass with minimal global disables, indicating the 
codebase already follows best practices and doesn't require these broad 
exemptions. No inline disables needed.

- pylint: Clean (no issues)
- pytest: All 1022 tests pass
- mypy: No type errors
```

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ✅
- Updated TASK_TRACKER.md with all Step 6 subtasks marked complete
- Documented implementation results in step_6.md

**Excellent outcome:** The codebase was already following pylint best practices, so no code changes or inline disables were needed. This demonstrates high code quality throughout the project.
