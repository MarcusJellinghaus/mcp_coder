# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! This confirms the issue. The package needs to be reinstalled. However, based on the CLAUDE.md instructions, I should not use Bash for installing packages. Let me check if there's guidance on this specific blocker. Looking at the conversation, it seems this is a known requirement and I should inform the user about this blocker.

Let me report this blocker to the user:

## ⚠️ BLOCKER: Package Reinstall Required Before Testing

I've started implementing **Step 5, Part B: Comprehensive Testing** and immediately encountered a known blocker.

### Issue

The new workflow package `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/` was created in previous steps but isn't recognized by Python's import system because:
- The package was installed in editable mode with `pip install -e .`
- Python's editable install caches the package structure
- New subpackages require reinstallation to be discovered

### Evidence

When I tried to run the create_pr workflow tests, pytest collected **0 tests** - this indicates the module cannot be imported.

### Solution Required

**You need to reinstall the package before I can run any tests:**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or using the batch script:
```bash
tools\reinstall.bat
```

### What This Will Fix

After reinstallation, the tests should work:
- ✅ All create_pr workflow tests will be discoverable
- ✅ CLI command tests will import correctly
- ✅ Integration tests will pass
- ✅ Code quality checks (pylint, mypy) will work on the new modules

### Next Steps

1. **You run:** `tools\reinstall.bat` (or `pip install -e .`)
2. **Then I'll continue** with all the comprehensive testing tasks

This is the same blocker encountered in Step 4, and is a known requirement when adding new Python packages/subpackages to an editable install.

**Ready to proceed once you've run the reinstall command!**
