# Implementation Task: Part C: Code Quality Validation

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part C: Code Quality Validation

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task tracker has been successfully updated. Part C is now marked as complete with all checkboxes showing `[x]`.

Selected: Part C: Code Quality Validation from Step 5

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT** ✅  
Ran all required code quality checks using MCP tools:
- ✅ Pylint on workflow package (`src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/`) - No issues
- ✅ Pylint on CLI command (`src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/`) - No issues
- ✅ Pylint on CLI main (`src/mcp_coder/cli/`) - No issues
- ✅ Mypy on workflow package - No type errors
- ✅ Mypy on CLI command - No type errors
- ✅ Mypy on CLI main - No type errors

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS** ✅  
All checks passed with no issues found

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION** ✅  
All requirements from Part C completed:
- All 6 sub-tasks (3 pylint + 3 mypy) executed successfully
- No errors or issues found

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ✅  
Prepared commit message:
```
feat(step5): complete Part C code quality validation

Ran all code quality checks on converted create-pr command:
- Pylint checks passed (workflow, CLI command, CLI main)
- Mypy type checks passed (workflow, CLI command, CLI main)

All code quality requirements met for Issue #139.
```

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ✅  
Updated `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`:
- Changed `- [ ] Part C: Code Quality Validation` to `- [x] Part C: Code Quality Validation`
- All sub-items also marked complete
- File successfully updated and verified

---

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
✅ Used MCP code-checker tools exclusively  
✅ All code quality checks passed  
✅ No issues remain unresolved  
✅ Task tracker properly updated

**Next Step:** Part D: Manual Functional Testing
