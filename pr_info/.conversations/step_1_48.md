# Implementation Task: Create `tests/workflows/create_pr/test_workflow.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `tests/workflows/create_pr/test_workflow.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The __init__.py exists and looks good. The issue is definitely that the package hasn't been reinstalled in the MCP code-checker's venv. Since I can't directly control the external venv, let me inform the user about this situation:

Based on the context:
1. The test file has been created successfully
2. The tests cannot run because the package needs to be reinstalled
3. Steps 4 and 5 mention "(requires package reinstall)" but the current Step 6 also depends on this

I should inform the user that the package needs to be reinstalled before the tests can run. However, since the CLAUDE.md says I must use MCP tools and should not fall back to Bash commands, I'm in a bind.

Let me try one more thing - let me see if there's a way to trigger a reinstall or if I should just proceed with the assumption that the tests are correct and will pass once the package is reinstalled:

Actually, looking at the error message more carefully, it shows the venv path: `..\\..\\mcp_coder_prod\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\python.py`. This is a DIFFERENT venv than the current project's `.venv`. The MCP code-checker is configured to use `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}` which appears to be pointing to a different location.

This is likely an environment variable configuration issue. The user needs to either:
1. Reinstall the package in the `mcp_coder_prod\.venv` environment, or
2. Update the environment variables to point to the correct venv

Since this is beyond what I can fix with the tools available, I should document this and proceed with verifying that the test file itself is syntactically correct. Let me check if I can at least validate the Python syntax:

Actually, let me re-read the workflow instructions. The user is asking me to implement the task, and the task validation includes running pytest. If pytest can't run due to environment issues, I should report this to the user.

Let me summarize the situation for the user and ask for guidance:

I've successfully created the `tests/workflows/create_pr/test_workflow.py` file with all 4 required tests as specified in step_6.md. However, I've encountered an environment configuration issue that's blocking test execution:

**Issue**: The MCP code-checker is using a venv at `mcp_coder_prod\.venv` which doesn't have the `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr` module installed. The package needs to be reinstalled in that environment before the tests can run.

**What I've completed**:
- ✅ Created `tests/workflows/create_pr/test_workflow.py` with 4 tests:
  1. `test_workflow_complete_success` - Tests happy path
  2. `test_workflow_prerequisites_fail` - Tests early exit on prerequisite failure
  3. `test_workflow_pr_creation_fails` - Tests failure when PR creation fails
  4. `test_workflow_generate_summary_exception` - Tests exception handling

**What's blocking**:
- The MCP code-checker's venv (`mcp_coder_prod\.venv`) needs the package reinstalled
- The error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'`

**Question**: Should I:
1. Proceed assuming the tests are correct and will pass after reinstall?
2. Wait for you to reinstall the package in the correct venv?
3. Try a different approach?

The steps 4 and 5 in the task tracker mention "(requires package reinstall)" and are marked complete, suggesting this should have been done already. However, the MCP code-checker isn't finding the module.
