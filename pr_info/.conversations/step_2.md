Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Prepare git commit message for Step 2

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the TASK_TRACKER.md to understand the current task and implement it.I can see that the current task is **"Prepare git commit message for Step 2"**. Let me first check what was implemented in Step 2 by looking at the recent git changes.I can see that Step 2 has already been committed in multiple commits. However, the task asks me to prepare a git commit message for Step 2. Let me check what exactly was implemented in Step 2 by looking at the changes.Let me check what specific changes were made in Step 2:I can see that Step 2 has already been committed with appropriate commit messages. The task "Prepare git commit message for Step 2" appears to be already completed since there are already commits for Step 2:
- `8051c53 feat(create_pr): complete utility functions for repository cleanup in step 2`
- `c0dfb5f feat(create_pr): complete tests for cleanup functions in step 2`

Let me verify that all the Step 2 work has been properly committed by checking if there are any uncommitted changes:There are no uncommitted changes. Since Step 2 has already been properly committed with appropriate commit messages, this task is actually already complete. Let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark this task as done:The task "Prepare git commit message for Step 2" is already complete. Step 2 was successfully committed with two commits:

1. `c0dfb5f feat(create_pr): complete tests for cleanup functions in step 2`
2. `8051c53 feat(create_pr): complete utility functions for repository cleanup in step 2`

These commits properly document the implementation of:
- Repository cleanup function tests in `tests/test_create_pr.py`
- Utility functions in `workflows/create_PR.py`

I've updated the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark this task as complete.

All Step 2 tasks are now marked as done:
- ✅ Create tests/test_create_pr.py with tests for cleanup functions
- ✅ Add utility functions to workflows/create_PR.py
- ✅ Run pylint check for Step 2 implementation
- ✅ Run pytest check for Step 2 implementation
- ✅ Run mypy check for Step 2 implementation
- ✅ Prepare git commit message for Step 2

The next available task would be Step 3, but you asked me to work on only one task.
