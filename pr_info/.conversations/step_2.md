# Implementation Task: Step 2: Add Tests for Save Conversation Functions (step_2.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 2: Add Tests for Save Conversation Functions (step_2.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll examine the task tracker and implement Step 2: Add Tests for Save Conversation Functions. Let me start by reading the task details.Now let me read the specific details for Step 2:Let me also check the tests README to understand the testing setup:Now let me examine the existing test file to understand the structure:I'll implement Step 2: Add Tests for Save Conversation Functions. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this implementation.Now let me start implementing the first test method. I'll mark it as in_progress and add the test methods to the existing test file.Now I'll add both test methods to the test file. I'll add them after the existing tests in the TestExecutePrompt class:Let me fix the parameter type:Great! Now let me mark the first two tasks as completed and move to the code quality checks:Now let me run the pylint check:As expected, the tests are failing because the functions don't exist yet (they will be implemented in Step 4). This is the intended TDD approach. Let me mark this as completed since the pylint errors are expected, and move to pytest:Now let me run pytest on the specific test file to see the expected failures:Let me check the structure and run pytest differently:Perfect! The tests are failing as expected because the functions don't exist yet. This is exactly what we want for TDD - the tests are written first and will pass once the functions are implemented in Step 4. Let me mark this as completed and move to mypy:Again, as expected, mypy is also finding that these functions don't exist yet. This is the correct TDD approach - the tests will guide the implementation in Step 4. Let me mark this task as completed:Now let me update the task tracker to mark Step 2 as completed:Perfect! Let me clean up the todo list since the step is complete:## Summary

**Step 2: Add Tests for Save Conversation Functions - COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

I have successfully implemented Step 2 following the TDD approach. Here's what was accomplished:

### ‚úÖ **Implementation Details:**

1. **Added `test_save_conversation_markdown_basic()` method**
   - Tests file creation and basic markdown content structure
   - Uses `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for test isolation
   - Verifies file exists and contains expected elements (prompt, response, session info, markdown headers)

2. **Added `test_save_conversation_full_json_basic()` method**
   - Tests JSON file creation and structure validation
   - Uses `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for test isolation  
   - Verifies valid JSON structure with expected conversation data

### ‚úÖ **Code Quality Checks:**

- **Pylint**: Expected failures (functions don't exist yet) ‚úÖ
- **Pytest**: Expected failures (functions don't exist yet) ‚úÖ  
- **Mypy**: Expected failures (functions don't exist yet) ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **TDD Approach Confirmed:**
The tests are written and fail as expected - they will guide the implementation of the save functions in Step 4. This follows proper Test-Driven Development methodology.

### üìù **Commit Message:**
```
test: add tests for save conversation functions

Added test_save_conversation_markdown_basic() and test_save_conversation_full_json_basic() 
test methods following TDD approach. Tests verify file creation and content structure 
for save functions that will be implemented in Step 4.
```

The task has been marked as completed in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`. The implementation is ready for the next step!
