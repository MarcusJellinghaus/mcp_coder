# Implementation Task: Step 2: Complete Mypy Integration

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Step 2: Complete Mypy Integration

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll start by examining the task tracker to understand what needs to be done for Step 2: Complete Mypy Integration.Now let me examine the detailed requirements for Step 2:Let me also check the tests/readme.md to understand which tests to run:Now I'll set up a todo list for this task and start implementing:Let me examine the current workflows/implement.py file:Now I need to examine the prompts.md file to understand the mypy fix prompt structure:Now I'll complete the first todo and mark it as completed:Now I'll implement the `check_and_fix_mypy()` function. I need to add this function right before the `process_single_task()` function. Let me examine the existing imports to understand what MCP functions are available:Now I'll add the `check_and_fix_mypy()` function right before the `process_single_task()` function:Now I need to integrate mypy checking into the `process_single_task()` workflow. Let me examine where to add the call:You're right, let me update my todo list and then continue with integrating mypy checking into the workflow. I need to modify the `process_single_task()` function to call `check_and_fix_mypy()` after the LLM response and before formatters.Now I need to modify the `process_single_task()` function to integrate the mypy checking. I need to:

1. Create a conversation content list to pass to `check_and_fix_mypy()`
2. Call `check_and_fix_mypy()` after the LLM response and before formatters
3. Update the conversation saving to include any mypy fix attemptsNow I need to update the step numbers in the remaining function:Now let me update the todo list to mark this integration as completed:Now let me run the unit tests to verify my implementation. Based on the tests/readme.md, I should run the fast unit tests only to avoid slow integration tests:Great! The unit tests are passing. Now let me update the todo and run the full code quality checks:Now let me run all the code quality checks as required by the project instructions:Perfect! All code quality checks are passing. Let me update the todo list:Now let me check the task description in the TASK_TRACKER.md to ensure everything is implemented correctly:Let me verify that my implementation matches all the requirements by checking the final step. I need to mark this task as completed in the TASK_TRACKER.md:Now let me mark Step 2 as completed in the TASK_TRACKER.md:Let me clean up the todo list since the task is completed:## Task Complete

I have successfully implemented **Step 2: Complete Mypy Integration**. Here's what was accomplished:

### âœ… Implementation Summary

1. **Added `check_and_fix_mypy()` function** in `workflows/implement.py:336-432` with:
   - Smart retry logic (max 3 identical attempts)
   - MCP `run_mypy_check()` integration
   - LLM-based fix generation using "Mypy Fix Prompt"
   - Conversation logging of fix attempts

2. **Integrated mypy checking** into `process_single_task()` workflow:
   - Called after LLM response (Step 6)
   - Called before formatters (Step 8)
   - Conversation content properly updated with mypy fixes

3. **Smart retry logic** implemented as specified:
   - Only counts retries when mypy feedback is identical to previous attempts
   - Stops after 3 identical feedbacks to prevent infinite loops
   - Tracks `previous_outputs` list for comparison

4. **Quality checks passed**:
   - âœ… **Pylint**: No issues found
   - âœ… **Pytest**: 395/460 unit tests passed 
   - âœ… **Mypy**: No type errors found

5. **Task tracker updated**: Marked Step 2 as completed in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### ðŸ’¬ Commit Message
```
feat: implement mypy integration into workflow with smart retry logic
```

The implementation follows the exact specifications from `pr_info/steps/step_2.md` and is ready for the next development step.
