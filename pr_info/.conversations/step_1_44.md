# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_coordinator_run_with_log_level()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_coordinator_run_with_log_level()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! I can see the task is now marked as complete with `[x]` on line 134. 

## Summary

✅ **Task completed successfully!**

**What was implemented:**
- Added test `test_coordinator_run_with_log_level()` in `tests/cli/test_main.py`
- Test verifies that the `--log-level DEBUG` flag is correctly passed through to the `execute_coordinator_run` handler
- Test follows the same pattern as existing tests in the `TestCoordinatorRunCommand` class

**Code quality verification:**
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Pytest: All 1109 tests pass (including the new test)
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

**Task tracker updated:**
- ✅ Marked `test_coordinator_run_with_log_level()` as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)
- Used MCP code checker tools for verification (`mcp__code-checker__run_pytest_check`, `mcp__code-checker__run_pylint_check`, `mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check`)
- All code quality checks passed before completion

The implementation is ready for the next task in the workflow.
