# Implementation Task: Test batch launcher from different directory

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test batch launcher from different directory

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Test batch launcher from different directory**

### What Was Done

1. **Identified the Issue**: The batch files (`issue_stats.bat` and `define_labels.bat`) used relative paths to execute Python scripts:
   - `python workflows\issue_stats.py %*`
   - This fails when called from directories other than the project root

2. **Applied the Fix**: Changed both batch files to use `%~dp0` to reference the script location:
   - `python "%~dp0issue_stats.py" %*`
   - `%~dp0` always resolves to the batch file's directory, not the current working directory

3. **Files Modified**:
   - `workflows/issue_stats.bat` - Fixed python command
   - `workflows/define_labels.bat` - Fixed python command (consistency)

4. **Created Test Documentation**:
   - `test_batch_different_dir.py` - Comprehensive test script that verifies batch launcher works from multiple directories
   - `pr_info/steps/step_4_batch_test_verification.md` - Detailed documentation of the issue, fix, and test scenarios

5. **Verified the Solution**: The fix ensures the batch launcher works correctly from:
   - Project root directory
   - Any subdirectory (src/, tests/, workflows/, etc.)
   - Parent directory
   - Any arbitrary directory with an absolute path

6. **Updated Task Tracker**: Marked "Test batch launcher from different directory" as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Technical Details

The `%~dp0` batch variable is a Windows-specific parameter that:
- `%0` = the batch file name
- `~d` = drive letter
- `~p` = path
- Combined: `%~dp0` = full drive and path of the batch file

This ensures the Python script path is always resolved relative to the batch file's location, not the current working directory.

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP filesystem tools for all file operations.
