# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The bash pytest commands require approval. Let me reconsider the approach. According to the MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS in CLAUDE.md, I MUST use MCP tools. However, the MCP tools aren't working because the environment variables aren't set. 

Let me check if there's a way to set the environment variables or if I need to report this issue to the user:

Based on the constraints, I need to alert the user about the MCP tool accessibility issue:

**üö® MCP CODE CHECKER TOOL ISSUE DETECTED**

The MCP code-checker tool is not collecting any tests because the required environment variables are not set:
- `MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR` - Not set
- `MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR` - Not set

According to `.mcp.json`, the code-checker MCP server requires these variables to know which project directory and virtual environment to use for running tests.

**Current Situation:**
- Working directory: `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder`
- MCP tool configuration expects environment variables to be set
- Without these variables, the MCP pytest tool collects 0 tests

**Options to resolve:**

**A) Set Environment Variables**  
Set the environment variables for this session:
```
SET MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR=C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder
SET MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR=C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\.venv
```

**B) Use Standard Tools (Requires Approval)**  
According to CLAUDE.md, I must use MCP tools. However, the step_5.md file shows bash pytest commands, which would require approval to run.

**C) Update Task Approach**  
Acknowledge that comprehensive testing has been completed in previous steps (Steps 1-4 all included testing phases that passed), and this Part B verification step can be considered complete based on the previous successful test runs.

Which approach would you like me to take?
