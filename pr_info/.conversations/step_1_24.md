# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see! You mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" but looking at the TASK_TRACKER.md, all implementation steps (1-8) are already marked as complete. 

**Based on TASK_TRACKER.md, there are NO incomplete implementation tasks.** All tasks show [x] for implementation. The only unchecked items are:
- Step 4, 5, 6, 8: "Prepare git commit message" (but you said NOT to perform commits)
- Final PR review section

**Could you please clarify:**
1. Is there a different task tracker you're referring to?
2. Or should I work on the "Final Review and Submission" section instead?
3. Or is there a new task about implementing something in core.py that's not yet in the tracker?

The current TASK_TRACKER.md shows all 8 implementation steps complete. Please let me know which specific task you'd like me to work on.
