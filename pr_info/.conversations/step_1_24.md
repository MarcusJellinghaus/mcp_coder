# Implementation Task: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need permission to edit the test file. Let me wait for user approval.

I'm working on **Step 8: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()`** in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`.

I need your permission to edit the test file to add the integration test. The test will:
1. Verify environment variables propagate correctly through both CLI and API methods
2. Make real Claude Code calls to ensure env_vars work end-to-end
3. Test that MCP servers can access the environment variables

Once you grant permission, I'll:
1. Add the `test_env_vars_propagation()` test
2. Run pylint, pytest, and mypy checks
3. Fix any issues
4. Mark the task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

Please approve the file edit so I can proceed.
