# Implementation Task: Run code quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Run code quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! All tasks for Step 5 are now marked as complete. Let me create a summary:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task**: Run code quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy (see step_5.md)

### What Was Done

1. **Ran all code quality checks**:
   - ✅ **Pylint**: No errors found
   - ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
   - ✅ **Pytest**: Initially found 2 failing tests

2. **Fixed test failures**:
   - **Root cause**: Mock decorator was patching the wrong location
   - **Issue**: Tests were patching `mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator.execute_coordinator_test` (where function is defined) instead of `mcp_coder.cli.main.execute_coordinator_test` (where it's imported and used)
   - **Fix**: Updated two test methods in `tests/cli/test_main.py`:
     - `test_coordinator_test_executes_handler` - tests/cli/test_main.py:299
     - `test_coordinator_test_with_log_level` - tests/cli/test_main.py:328

3. **Verified all tests pass**:
   - ✅ All 1055 tests passing after fix

### Prepared Commit Message

```
fix(tests): correct mock patch path for coordinator tests

Fix failing tests in test_main.py by patching execute_coordinator_test
at the import location (cli.main) rather than definition location
(cli.commands.coordinator). All 1055 tests now pass.

```

### Task Tracker Updates

✅ Marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`:
- [x] Run code quality checks: pylint, pytest, mypy
- [x] Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found
- [x] Prepare git commit message for Step 5

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** ✓

- Used MCP filesystem tools for all file operations
- Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- All three checks (pylint, pytest, mypy) passed
- Fixed all issues found
