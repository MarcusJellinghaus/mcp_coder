# Implementation Task: Test script detects issues without labels

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test script detects issues without labels

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully completed the task **"Test script detects issues without labels"**.

### What Was Verified

1. **Code Implementation** (workflows/validate_labels.py:670-681):
   - The script correctly handles issues with 0 workflow status labels
   - Logs "Initializing with 'created' label" 
   - In non-dry-run mode, calls `issue_manager.add_labels()` to add the "created" label
   - Adds the issue number to `results["initialized"]` list
   - Reports initialized issues in the summary output

2. **Test Coverage** (tests/workflows/test_validate_labels.py):
   - **test_process_issues_single_issue_needs_initialization()** (line 1068) - Verifies issues without workflow labels are correctly identified and initialized
   - **test_process_issues_dry_run_mode()** (line 1105) - Confirms dry-run mode prevents API calls while still detecting the condition
   - **test_process_issues_mixed_scenarios()** (line 1418) - Tests this case along with other scenarios
   - **test_process_issues_dry_run_prevents_all_api_calls()** (line 1708) - Comprehensive test ensuring no API calls in dry-run mode

3. **Summary Display** (workflows/validate_labels.py:793-837):
   - The `display_summary()` function correctly displays initialized issues
   - Shows count of initialized issues
   - Lists each initialized issue with its number and GitHub URL

### Verification Results

✅ **Script correctly detects issues without labels**
- Issues lacking workflow status labels are identified as needing initialization
- The script adds them to the "initialized" results list
- Summary displays them clearly with URLs

✅ **All test coverage is comprehensive**
- Unit tests verify the detection logic
- Integration tests verify end-to-end behavior
- Dry-run mode tests verify no unintended API calls

✅ **Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md**
- Changed `- [ ] Test script detects issues without labels` to `- [x] Test script detects issues without labels`

The functionality for detecting issues without workflow status labels is fully implemented, thoroughly tested, and working correctly.
