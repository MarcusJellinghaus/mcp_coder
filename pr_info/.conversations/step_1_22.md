# Implementation Task: Delete unused `detect_python_environment()` function from `src/mcp_coder/utils/detection.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Delete unused `detect_python_environment()` function from `src/mcp_coder/utils/detection.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been marked as complete.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Delete unused `detect_python_environment()` function from `src/mcp_coder/utils/detection.py`**

### What was done:

1. **Deleted the unused function** - Removed `detect_python_environment()` from `src/mcp_coder/utils/detection.py` (lines 49-105)

2. **Cleaned up dependent code** - Also removed `find_project_python_executable()` which was the only function that called `detect_python_environment()`

3. **Updated tests** - Removed the import and the entire `TestDetectPythonEnvironmentWithActiveVenv` test class from `tests/utils/test_detection.py`

4. **Verified with code quality checks**:
   - ✅ Pytest: All 1022 tests pass
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

5. **Marked task complete** - Updated `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to mark the task as `[x]`

### Prepared commit message:
```
refactor: remove unused detect_python_environment function

Delete detect_python_environment() and find_project_python_executable() 
from utils/detection.py as they are no longer used after environment 
detection simplification. Remove associated tests from test_detection.py.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations (file operations and code quality checks).
