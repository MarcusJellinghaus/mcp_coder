# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see - Step 5 mentions `workflows/implement/core.py`, and that step is already marked as complete. Let me verify what the actual next incomplete task is:

Based on the TASK_TRACKER.md, **all implementation is complete**. The only remaining tasks are:
1. Preparing commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8
2. Final PR review and submission

Since you asked me to "pick the next task that should be done" and mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions", but this doesn't match any task in the tracker, I need clarification.

**Current Status:**
- All code implementation (Steps 1-8) is marked as complete âœ…
- Working tree is clean (no pending changes)
- Missing: Commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, 8

**Question:** Could you clarify which task you'd like me to work on? The options are:
1. Prepare commit message for Step 4 (Interface Layer)
2. Prepare commit message for Step 5 (Workflows)  
3. Prepare commit message for Step 6 (CLI Commands)
4. Prepare commit message for Step 8 (Integration Testing)
5. Something else related to "core.py with utilities and type definitions"?

If there's a different task list or if the TASK_TRACKER.md is out of date, please let me know where I should look for the correct task information.
