# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see - I'm restricted to the current working directory. The issue is that the tests are running against an older installed version of the package. The MCP code checker is using the production virtual environment, which hasn't been updated with the latest source code changes.

Based on the error messages, it's clear that:
1. The source code exists in the current directory (`targets/mcp_coder/src`)
2. The tests exist in the current directory (`targets/mcp_coder/tests`)
3. But pytest is importing from the installed package in `mcp_coder_prod/.venv`

The solution is to reinstall the package with the latest code. However, since I can't access the setup scripts directly, let me inform the user about the issue and provide guidance:

The tests are failing because:

1. **Package not installed/updated**: The pytest tests are running against an outdated version of the mcp-coder package installed in `mcp_coder_prod/.venv`, but the source code with the new features exists in the current `targets/mcp_coder/src` directory.

2. **Missing imports**: The tests are trying to import:
   - `mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator` module ✓ (exists in source)
   - `create_default_config` from `mcp_coder.utils.user_config` ✓ (exists in source)
   
   Both exist in the source code but aren't available in the installed package.

**To fix this issue, you need to reinstall the mcp-coder package** to pick up the latest source code changes. According to the CLAUDE.md instructions, there should be a `reinstall_coder.bat` script in `local-windows/setup/`.

**Please run the following command manually:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\setup
reinstall_coder.bat
```

This should reinstall the mcp-coder package from the current source code into the production virtual environment, after which the tests should pass.

**Alternatively, if you want me to attempt to manually reinstall the package**, I would need:
1. Permission to navigate to the parent directories
2. Permission to run the reinstall script

Would you like me to:
1. Wait for you to run the reinstall script manually, or
2. Attempt to find and run the reinstall script (requires additional permissions)?
