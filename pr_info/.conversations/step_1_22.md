Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need write permission for the test file. I'm implementing the `test_env_vars_propagation()` integration test in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py` as specified in Step 8.

The test will:
1. Verify environment variables propagate through CLI method
2. Verify environment variables propagate through API method  
3. Make real Claude Code calls to ensure env_vars work end-to-end

Please grant permission to edit the file so I can proceed with the implementation.
