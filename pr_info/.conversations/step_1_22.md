# Implementation Task: Test batch launcher with --ignore-labels flag

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test batch launcher with --ignore-labels flag

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Completion Summary

✅ **Task Complete: Test batch launcher with --ignore-labels flag**

### What Was Implemented

I added comprehensive test coverage for the batch launcher's `--ignore-labels` flag functionality by creating 4 new test functions in `tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py`:

1. **`test_batch_launcher_ignore_labels_argument_passthrough()`** - Verifies that multiple `--ignore-labels` flags are correctly passed through the batch launcher's `%*` argument pass-through mechanism.

2. **`test_batch_launcher_ignore_labels_combined_with_other_flags()`** - Ensures `--ignore-labels` works correctly when combined with other flags like `--filter` and `--details`.

3. **`test_ignore_labels_integration_with_filtering()`** - Tests the complete end-to-end flow from parsing CLI arguments through to filtering issues, verifying that ignored labels are properly excluded from results.

4. **`test_ignore_labels_with_labels_containing_special_characters()`** - Validates that labels containing special characters (colons, dashes, spaces) are handled correctly by both the batch launcher and Python script.

### Code Quality Verification

All code quality checks passed:
- ✅ **Pytest**: 948 tests passed, 4 skipped (fast unit tests only)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Key Test Coverage

The tests verify that:
- The batch launcher correctly passes `--ignore-labels` arguments through to the Python script
- Multiple `--ignore-labels` flags can be specified (e.g., `--ignore-labels "wontfix" --ignore-labels "duplicate"`)
- The flag works in combination with other flags (`--filter`, `--details`, etc.)
- Issues with ignored labels are properly excluded from statistics
- Labels with special characters are handled correctly

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used only MCP tools for file operations and code quality checks.
