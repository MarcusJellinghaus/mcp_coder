# Implementation Task: Remove outdated venv requirement statements

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Remove outdated venv requirement statements

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ Task marked as complete.

## Summary

I've successfully completed the task **"Remove outdated venv requirement statements"** from Step 4.

**What I did:**
1. ✅ Searched all documentation files for venv/environment references
2. ✅ Reviewed README.md - found no outdated statements
3. ✅ Reviewed ARCHITECTURE.md - documentation is already accurate
4. ✅ Checked all other docs/ markdown files - no venv-related content
5. ✅ Verified all code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
6. ✅ Marked the task as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Finding:**
No outdated venv requirement statements were found in the documentation. The documentation already accurately reflects the simplified environment detection approach that:
- Works universally with venv, conda, or system Python
- Has no platform-specific requirements
- Uses environment variables instead of filesystem detection

**Prepared Commit Message (for when Step 4 is fully complete):**
```
docs(step4): verify no outdated venv requirements exist

Verified all documentation files (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and docs/)
for outdated virtual environment requirement statements.

Finding: No outdated statements found. Documentation already accurately
reflects the simplified environment detection that works with venv,
conda, or system Python without platform-specific requirements.

No changes needed - documentation is correct as-is.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools for all file operations
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
