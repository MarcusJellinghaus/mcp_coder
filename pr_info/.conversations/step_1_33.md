# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_dispatch_failure_fail_fast()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_dispatch_failure_fail_fast()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Let me provide a summary of what was completed:

## Task Completion Summary

✅ **Successfully implemented test: `test_execute_coordinator_run_dispatch_failure_fail_fast()`**

### What was done:

1. **Test Implementation** (tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:2012-2175)
   - Added comprehensive test for fail-fast behavior on dispatch errors
   - Test verifies that when `dispatch_workflow()` raises an exception on the 2nd issue:
     - First issue is processed successfully
     - Second issue encounters error and execution stops immediately
     - Third issue is NOT processed (fail-fast behavior)
     - Exit code 1 is returned
   - Test includes 3 mock issues with different labels
   - Properly mocks all dependencies (config, Jenkins, GitHub managers)

2. **Code Quality Verification**
   - ✅ Pytest: Test passes successfully
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

3. **Task Tracker Updated**
   - Marked the task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Test Coverage:
The test verifies the fail-fast error handling requirement from the specification, ensuring that:
- The coordinator stops processing immediately when a workflow dispatch fails
- Only 2 dispatch attempts are made (not 3)
- Appropriate error handling and exit code are returned
- All manager instances are properly initialized before the error occurs

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**: Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
