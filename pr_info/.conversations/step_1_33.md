# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The package is installed but doesn't have the new `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr` module because it needs to be reinstalled. The error message is clear: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'`.

According to the CLAUDE.md instructions and the task requirements, I need to reinstall the package to pick up the new module structure. This is a critical step that was mentioned in Step 4's validation requirements.

Let me ask the user to approve the package reinstall, as this is required to complete the testing:

**⚠️ Package Reinstallation Required**

The tests are failing because the installed `mcp-coder` package doesn't include the new `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/` module that was created in previous steps.

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr'`

**Required Action:**  
I need to reinstall the package in editable mode to pick up the new module structure:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This was mentioned as a requirement in Step 4's validation notes: "requires package reinstall".

**Question:** May I proceed with reinstalling the package? This is necessary to:
1. Make the new `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr` module available
2. Run all the comprehensive tests for Step 5 Part B
3. Complete the workflow conversion validation

The reinstall is safe and only updates the package metadata to include the new files created in Steps 1-4.
