# Implementation Task: Perform manual integration testing with real GitHub API

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Perform manual integration testing with real GitHub API

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see that running the script requires user approval since it will interact with the GitHub API. Let me explain the situation to the user and document what needs to be tested:

Based on my review of the code and requirements, I need to perform **manual integration testing with the real GitHub API**. However, since this requires running commands that interact with external APIs, I need your approval to proceed.

## Manual Integration Testing Plan

I've reviewed the `validate_labels.py` script and `validate_labels.bat` wrapper. Here's what needs to be tested:

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Help Flag Test**
   ```
   workflows\validate_labels.bat --help
   ```
   Expected: Display help message with all options

2. **Dry-Run Test**
   ```
   workflows\validate_labels.bat --dry-run
   ```
   Expected: Preview validation results without making any changes to GitHub

3. **Debug Logging Test**
   ```
   workflows\validate_labels.bat --log-level DEBUG
   ```
   Expected: Show detailed processing information

4. **Normal Run Test**
   ```
   workflows\validate_labels.bat
   ```
   Expected: Perform actual validation and initialize any issues missing status labels

5. **Exit Code Verification**
   ```
   workflows\validate_labels.bat
   echo %ERRORLEVEL%
   ```
   Expected exit codes:
   - `0` = Success (no errors or warnings)
   - `1` = Errors found (multiple status labels)
   - `2` = Warnings only (stale bot processes)

### What the Script Does:

The script validates GitHub issue labels by:
- Checking each open issue for workflow status labels
- Initializing issues without labels to "created" status
- Detecting errors (issues with multiple status labels)
- Detecting warnings (stale bot_busy processes that exceed timeout thresholds)
- Respecting ignore_labels (e.g., "Overview" label)

Would you like me to proceed with running these integration tests? I'll need your approval to execute commands that interact with the GitHub API.

Alternatively, you can run these tests manually and report back the results, and I can document the findings and complete the task.
