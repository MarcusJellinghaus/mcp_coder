# Implementation Task: Update help text for --ignore-labels flag in issue_stats.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update help text for --ignore-labels flag in issue_stats.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ Task completed successfully!

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task to **update help text for --ignore-labels flag in issue_stats.py**.

### What was changed:
- **File**: `workflows/issue_stats.py:320`
- **Before**: `"Additional labels to ignore (can be used multiple times)"`
- **After**: `"Additional labels to ignore beyond JSON config defaults (can be used multiple times)"`

### Why this matters:
The updated help text now explicitly clarifies that the `--ignore-labels` CLI flag **adds to** (not replaces) the ignore labels defined in the JSON configuration file. This prevents user confusion about the additive behavior.

### Verification:
✅ All code quality checks passed:
- **Pytest**: 983 tests passed, 4 skipped
- **Mypy**: No type errors
- **Pylint**: Clean (one pre-existing false positive unrelated to this change)

✅ Task marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.

The implementation is complete and ready. The next task in the tracker is to create `workflows/config/__init__.py` with a minimal docstring.
