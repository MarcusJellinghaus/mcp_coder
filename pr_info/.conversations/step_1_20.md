# Implementation Task: Test batch file runs Python script correctly

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test batch file runs Python script correctly

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. 

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task **"Test batch file runs Python script correctly"** from Step 5. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added 5 comprehensive batch file integration tests** to `tests/workflows/test_validate_labels.py`:
   - `test_batch_file_exists()` - Verifies the batch file exists
   - `test_batch_file_runs_python_script()` - Tests execution with --help flag
   - `test_batch_file_forwards_arguments()` - Verifies all arguments are forwarded
   - `test_batch_file_handles_invalid_arguments()` - Tests error handling
   - `test_batch_file_preserves_exit_codes()` - Verifies exit code preservation

2. **Fixed import statement** in test file to use package-level import:
   - Changed from: `from mcp_coder.utils.github_operations.issue_manager import EventData, IssueData`
   - Changed to: `from mcp_coder.utils.github_operations import EventData, IssueData`

### Verification Results:
✅ All 5 batch file tests pass
✅ Mypy type checking passes with no errors
✅ Tests verify the batch file correctly:
   - Exists and is accessible
   - Executes the Python script
   - Forwards all command-line arguments
   - Handles invalid arguments properly
   - Preserves exit codes from the Python script

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
test(validate-labels): add batch file integration tests for Step 5.1

Add comprehensive tests to verify validate_labels.bat correctly executes
the Python script and forwards all command-line arguments.
```

### Task Status:
✅ Task marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed: Used MCP tools for all operations, ran code quality checks, and verified all tests pass.
