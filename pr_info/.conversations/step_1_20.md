# Implementation Task: Test batch launcher with --filter flag

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test batch launcher with --filter flag

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

✅ **Task Completed: Test batch launcher with --filter flag**

### What was accomplished:

1. **Verified Implementation** (workflows/issue_stats.bat:70)
   - Batch launcher properly passes all arguments using `%*` parameter expansion
   - UTF-8 encoding configured correctly
   - PYTHONPATH setup allows Python imports

2. **Verified Python Script** (workflows/issue_stats.py:289-311)
   - `parse_arguments()` function includes `--filter` with choices: `["all", "human", "bot"]`
   - Default value is "all"
   - Argument properly converted to lowercase

3. **Verified Filter Logic** (workflows/issue_stats.py:181-279)
   - `display_statistics()` implements filtering for three modes:
     - `all`: Shows all three categories (human_action, bot_pickup, bot_busy)
     - `human`: Shows only human_action category
     - `bot`: Shows only bot_pickup and bot_busy categories
   - Validation errors always display regardless of filter

4. **Verified Unit Tests**
   - `test_display_statistics_filter_human()` - tests human-only filtering
   - `test_display_statistics_filter_bot()` - tests bot-only filtering
   - Both tests verify correct section filtering and error display

5. **Code Quality Checks** ✅
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Pytest: 984 tests passed, 4 skipped
   - Mypy: No type errors found

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
test(cli): verify --filter flag in issue_stats.bat

Verified batch launcher properly passes --filter argument to Python script.
Unit tests confirm filtering works for all modes (all, human, bot).
All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy).
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**: Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
