# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need to report this situation to the user:

## Analysis of Test Failures

I've investigated the pytest failures and found a **critical environment mismatch issue**:

### The Problem

1. **Current Working Directory**: `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\targets\mcp_coder`
   - This is where all the code changes exist
   - All required files are present and correct:
     - ✅ `src/mcp_coder/utils/user_config.py` with `create_default_config()` function
     - ✅ `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py` with all required functions
     - ✅ `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py` with coordinator command integrated
     - ✅ `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/__init__.py` properly exports coordinator module

2. **Test Execution Environment**: Tests are running using the venv from:
   - `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod\.venv`
   - The installed package there appears to be outdated or missing the new changes

3. **Test Failures**: All failures are import/module errors because the production installation doesn't have the changes:
   - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator'`
   - `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_default_config'`
   - `ArgumentError: invalid choice: 'coordinator'`

### Required Action

The mcp-coder package needs to be reinstalled in editable mode in the `mcp_coder_prod` environment to pick up the changes from the `targets/mcp_coder` directory.

**Options:**

1. **Run the reinstall script** (requires manual intervention):
   ```batch
   cd C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod
   call .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   call tools\reinstall.bat
   ```

2. **Direct pip install** (requires approval for bash command):
   ```batch
   C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod\.venv\Scripts\pip install -e C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\targets\mcp_coder
   ```

### Question

Should I proceed with option 2 (requires your approval for the bash command), or would you prefer to run the reinstall script manually?

Note: Once the package is reinstalled, all tests should pass as the code implementation is complete and correct.
