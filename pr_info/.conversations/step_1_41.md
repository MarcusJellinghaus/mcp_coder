# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 0: SHOW CONFIGURATION TASK**
- Please check which MCP servers you have. What can you use them for? Which tools are you allowed to use. Please list them.
  Do you have full acces to the MCP servers / tools?

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need to understand what you're asking for. The current TASK_TRACKER.md shows that `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py` already exists and is complete. 

**Could you please clarify:**

1. Are you asking me to create a **different** `core.py` file (perhaps in a different location)?
2. Or are you asking me to work on the **current incomplete tasks** in TASK_TRACKER.md (which are preparing git commit messages for steps 4, 5, 6, and 8)?
3. Or is there a separate task list that I should be looking at?

**Current Status Summary:**

**‚úÖ MCP Server Configuration:**
- **Code Checker Tools:** Available (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- **Filesystem Tools:** NOT available (listed in prompt but not accessible)
- I have full access to the code-checker MCP tools

**üìã Current TASK_TRACKER.md Status:**
- Most implementation steps (1-8) are complete
- Remaining tasks: Git commit messages for steps 4, 5, 6, 8
- Final PR review and submission pending

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note on CLAUDE.md Compliance:**
The CLAUDE.md mandates using MCP filesystem tools, but they are not actually available in this environment. I will need to use standard tools (Read, Write, Edit) for file operations while using MCP code-checker tools for quality checks.

Please let me know which task you'd like me to work on!
