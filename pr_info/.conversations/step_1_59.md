# Implementation Task: Set up comprehensive mocks for all dependencies

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Set up comprehensive mocks for all dependencies

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully completed the task **"Set up comprehensive mocks for all dependencies"** from Step 6 of the implementation plan.

### What was done:

1. **Verified comprehensive mock setup** - All integration and edge case tests in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py` have comprehensive mocks configured with proper decorators:
   - `create_default_config`
   - `load_repo_config`
   - `get_jenkins_credentials`
   - `IssueBranchManager`
   - `IssueManager`
   - `JenkinsClient`
   - `load_labels_config`

2. **Validated test functionality** - All 10 integration and edge case tests pass successfully:
   - `TestCoordinatorRunIntegration` (7 tests)
   - `TestCoordinatorRunEdgeCases` (3 tests)

3. **Verified complete workflow** - The tests verify:
   - ✅ Jobs triggered correctly
   - ✅ Labels updated correctly
   - ✅ Priority ordering works
   - ✅ Filtering logic works
   - ✅ Fail-fast behavior works

4. **Code quality checks** - All checks pass:
   - ✅ Pytest: 53/53 tests pass in coordinator test file
   - ✅ Pylint: No errors or fatal issues
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

5. **Updated TASK_TRACKER.md** - Marked the task as complete with `[x]`

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved

The comprehensive mock setup is complete and working correctly. The tests provide excellent coverage of the coordinator run functionality including happy paths, error cases, and edge cases.
