## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Fix the mypy type errors shown in the output below.

Focus only on resolving the type errors - do not make unnecessary changes to the code.

For each error:
1. Understand the type mismatch or missing annotation
2. Add appropriate type hints or fix incorrect types
3. Use proper typing imports (List, Dict, Optional, etc.) from typing module
4. Ensure all function parameters and return types are properly annotated

Keep changes minimal and focused on type correctness.

Expected output: Code changes that resolve all type errors while maintaining functionality.

## LLM Fix Response:
The mypy type errors are caused by missing type stubs for the `requests` library. The `types-requests` package is already listed in the development dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, but it needs to be installed.

To fix these errors, you need to install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Or specifically install the types package:

```bash
pip install types-requests
```

The `types-requests>=2.28.0` package is already properly configured in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `dev` optional dependencies section, so once installed, these mypy errors will be resolved automatically.
