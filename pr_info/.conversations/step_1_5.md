## Summary

**Task completed:** Step 5 - Repository Labels & Add Labels Operations

### What was implemented:

1. ✅ **`get_available_labels()` method** (src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_manager.py:469-516)
   - Returns `List[LabelData]` with all repository labels
   - Uses `@log_function_call` decorator
   - Hybrid error handling (raises on auth errors 401/403, returns [] on others)
   - Converts GitHub label objects to LabelData TypedDict format

2. ✅ **`add_labels()` method** (src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_manager.py:518-651)
   - Takes `issue_number: int` and `*labels: str` using variadic args
   - Returns `IssueData` with updated issue information
   - Uses `@log_function_call` decorator
   - Validates issue_number and labels
   - Hybrid error handling (raises on auth errors 401/403, returns empty dict on others)
   - Fetches fresh issue data after adding labels

3. ✅ **Unit tests added** (tests/utils/test_issue_manager.py:385-612)
   - `test_get_available_labels_success` - Tests successful label retrieval
   - `test_get_available_labels_auth_error_raises` - Tests auth error handling
   - `test_add_labels_success` - Tests adding multiple labels with *args
   - `test_add_labels_single_label` - Tests adding single label
   - `test_add_labels_invalid_issue_number` - Tests validation
   - `test_add_labels_no_labels_provided` - Tests empty labels validation
   - `test_add_labels_auth_error_raises` - Tests auth error handling

4. ✅ **All quality checks passed:**
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Pytest: 22/22 tests passed in test_issue_manager.py
   - Mypy: No type errors found
