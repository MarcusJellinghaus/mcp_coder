# Implementation Task: Remove unused imports (argparse, sys if unused) (step_2d.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Remove unused imports (argparse, sys if unused) (step_2d.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All tasks for Step 2d are now marked as complete. Let me verify the changes and provide a summary:

## Task Completion Summary

**Step 2d: Clean Up Imports and Verify Quality** ✅

I have successfully completed all requirements from step_2d.md:

### What was done:
1. **Removed unused argparse import** - The `argparse` module is no longer needed since `parse_arguments()` was deleted in step_2c
2. **Kept sys import** - The `sys` module is still used by `_load_prompt_or_exit()` and `resolve_project_dir()` functions for `sys.exit()` calls
3. **Verified module imports successfully** - Confirmed the function signature is correct
4. **All code quality checks passed:**
   - ✅ Pylint: No errors or fatal issues
   - ✅ Pytest: 1088 tests passed (fast unit tests only, excluding slow integration tests)
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

### File modified:
- `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_plan.py:9` - Removed `import argparse`

### Verification results:
- Function signature: `run_create_plan_workflow(issue_number: int, project_dir: Path, provider: str, method: str) -> int` ✅
- Module imports successfully ✅
- All quality checks pass ✅

### Commit message prepared:
```
refactor(workflows): remove unused argparse import (step_2d)

Clean up imports in create_plan workflow after CLI parsing removal.
- Removed unused argparse import
- Kept sys import (still used by _load_prompt_or_exit and resolve_project_dir)
- All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools for file operations
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
