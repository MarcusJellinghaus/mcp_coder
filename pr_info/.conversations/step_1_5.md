# Implementation Task: Write tests for `BaseGitHubManager` with `repo_url` (new behavior)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write tests for `BaseGitHubManager` with `repo_url` (new behavior)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Complete! ✅

I have successfully completed the task: **Write tests for `BaseGitHubManager` with `repo_url` (new behavior)**

### Summary of Implementation:

**Added comprehensive test coverage** for the new `repo_url` initialization mode in `tests/utils/github_operations/test_base_manager.py`:

**New Test Class:** `TestBaseGitHubManagerWithRepoUrl` with 10 test methods covering:

1. **Initialization tests:**
   - HTTPS URL with .git extension: `test_successful_initialization_with_https_repo_url`
   - HTTPS URL without .git extension: `test_successful_initialization_with_https_repo_url_no_git_extension`
   - SSH URL format: `test_successful_initialization_with_ssh_repo_url`

2. **Error handling tests:**
   - Invalid GitHub URL (e.g., GitLab): `test_initialization_fails_invalid_repo_url`
   - Malformed URL: `test_initialization_fails_malformed_repo_url`
   - Missing GitHub token: `test_initialization_fails_no_github_token`

3. **Repository fetching tests:**
   - `_get_repository()` works correctly: `test_get_repository_with_repo_url_mode`
   - Repository object caching: `test_get_repository_caching_with_repo_url`
   - GitHub API error handling: `test_get_repository_github_api_error_with_repo_url`
   - Generic exception handling: `test_get_repository_generic_exception_with_repo_url`

### Verification Results:
- ✅ **All 38 tests pass** (21 existing + 17 new) in test_base_manager.py
- ✅ **Pylint:** No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy:** Pre-existing issues in other files, no new issues introduced
- ✅ **Task marked complete** in TASK_TRACKER.md

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
