# Implementation Task: Implement `create_remote_branch_for_issue()` with duplicate prevention

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement `create_remote_branch_for_issue()` with duplicate prevention

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! All tasks are complete. Let me now prepare a concise commit message summary:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **Step 3: Create Linked Branch** with all requirements met:

### ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

**File: `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_branch_manager.py:202-336`**

Implemented `create_remote_branch_for_issue()` method with:
- ‚úÖ Duplicate prevention (default behavior when `allow_multiple=False`)
- ‚úÖ `allow_multiple` parameter to allow multiple branches per issue
- ‚úÖ Auto-generation of branch names using `generate_branch_name_from_issue()`
- ‚úÖ Custom branch name support
- ‚úÖ Custom base branch support
- ‚úÖ GraphQL `createLinkedBranch` mutation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with `@_handle_github_errors` decorator
- ‚úÖ Proper logging with `@log_function_call` decorator

**File: `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/__init__.py:6-26`**

Added exports to make the module accessible:
- `IssueBranchManager`
- `BranchCreationResult`
- `generate_branch_name_from_issue`

### ‚úÖ Code Quality Checks - All Passed

- **Pylint**: ‚úÖ No errors or warnings in implemented code
- **Pytest**: ‚úÖ All 134 tests pass in `tests/utils/github_operations/`
- **Mypy**: ‚úÖ No type errors

### üìù Suggested Commit Message

```
feat(issue-branch): implement create_remote_branch_for_issue with duplicate prevention

Add create_remote_branch_for_issue() method to IssueBranchManager class:
- Implements duplicate prevention by default (allow_multiple=False)
- Allows multiple branches per issue when allow_multiple=True
- Auto-generates branch names from issue title
- Supports custom branch names and base branches
- Uses GraphQL createLinkedBranch mutation
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Updates __init__.py exports for module accessibility

All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy).
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ‚úÖ Used MCP tools exclusively
- ‚úÖ All code quality checks passed
- ‚úÖ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
