# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Based on my analysis:

## Status Report

**Current Situation:**
- All implementation steps (Steps 1-8) in TASK_TRACKER.md are marked as **complete** [x]
- The `core.py` file at `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py` already exists and is fully implemented
- Git working tree is clean (no pending changes)

**Remaining Work:**
The only unchecked items in TASK_TRACKER.md are:
1. Prepare commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8
2. Final PR review and submission

**Question:**
The task you mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" doesn't match any pending task in TASK_TRACKER.md. The `core.py` file has already been implemented in Step 5.

Could you please clarify:
1. Is there a different task you'd like me to work on?
2. Should I prepare the missing commit messages for the completed steps?
3. Or should I proceed with the final PR review?

Please let me know which direction you'd like me to take!
