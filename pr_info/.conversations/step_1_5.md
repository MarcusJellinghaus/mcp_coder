# Implementation Task: Update existing test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_success` (remove detect_python_environment mock)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update existing test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_success` (remove detect_python_environment mock)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ The task has been successfully marked as complete in the TASK_TRACKER.md file.

## Task Completion Summary

**✅ TASK COMPLETED:** Update existing test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_success` (remove detect_python_environment mock)

### What Was Done:
1. **Updated test in** `tests/llm/test_env.py:99`
   - Removed mock for `detect_python_environment()`
   - Added `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable mock
   - Changed venv location to demonstrate runner/project separation
   - Simplified test structure with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Code Quality Results:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: Test fails as expected (TDD RED phase) - correct behavior
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors

### Expected Behavior (TDD RED Phase):
The test currently **fails** because the implementation (`prepare_llm_environment()`) still uses the old `detect_python_environment()` logic. This is the correct TDD approach - the test defines the expected behavior, and Step 2 will update the implementation to make it pass (GREEN phase).

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
test(env): update test_prepare_llm_environment_success to use VIRTUAL_ENV

Remove detect_python_environment mock and use VIRTUAL_ENV environment
variable instead. Separates runner venv from project directory to align
with new environment detection approach.

Part of Step 1 (TDD Red Phase) - test defines expected behavior.
```

### Task Tracker Status:
- ✅ Task marked as `[x]` complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:** Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
