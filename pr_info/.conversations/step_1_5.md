Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Now let me provide a summary and the commit message:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `calculate_label_changes()` pure function and its comprehensive test suite:

### Implementation Details

**File: `workflows/define_labels.py`**
- Added `calculate_label_changes()` function (lines 71-136)
- Pure function with no side effects or logging
- Compares existing vs target labels to determine: create, update, delete, unchanged
- Only considers `status-*` labels for deletion (preserves non-status labels)
- Uses efficient O(1) lookups with dict/set data structures

**File: `tests/workflows/test_define_labels.py`**
- Added `TestCalculateLabelChanges` class with 8 comprehensive unit tests
- All tests pass ✅

### Test Coverage (8 tests)
1. `test_calculate_label_changes_empty_repo` - Empty repository scenario
2. `test_calculate_label_changes_creates_new_labels` - New label creation
3. `test_calculate_label_changes_updates_existing_labels` - Label updates
4. `test_calculate_label_changes_deletes_obsolete_status_labels` - Obsolete label deletion
5. `test_calculate_label_changes_skips_unchanged_labels` - Unchanged label detection
6. `test_calculate_label_changes_preserves_non_status_labels` - Non-status label preservation
7. `test_calculate_label_changes_partial_match` - Partial match (5 of 10 labels exist)
8. `test_calculate_label_changes_all_exist_unchanged` - All labels exist unchanged

### Code Quality Checks ✅
- **Pylint**: No issues
- **Mypy**: No type errors
- **Pytest**: All 26 tests pass (18 existing + 8 new)

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.

### Suggested Commit Message
