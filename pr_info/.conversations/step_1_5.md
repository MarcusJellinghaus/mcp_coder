## LLM Response:
I'll start by reading the TASK_TRACKER.md file to understand the current task and its requirements.Now let me check the Step 2 details to understand what utility functions need to be added:Let me check what files exist in the pr_info directory:Let me check the step 2 details:I'm working on **Step 2: Add utility functions to workflows/create_PR.py**. Let me track this task and break it down into subtasks.Let me first check the existing test file to see what's already been done:Good! The tests are already written. Now let me check if the workflows/create_PR.py file exists:Great! The utility functions are already implemented. Now let me update the todo list and run the code quality checks:Excellent! All checks pass. Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md file to mark this task as complete:## Summary

I've successfully completed **Step 2: Add utility functions to workflows/create_PR.py**:

âœ… **Completed Tasks:**
- Found that the test file `tests/test_create_pr.py` with comprehensive tests was already created
- Found that the utility functions in `workflows/create_PR.py` were already implemented
- Ran pylint check - passed with no issues
- Ran pytest check - all 12 tests passed
- Ran mypy check - no type errors found
- Updated TASK_TRACKER.md to mark all Step 2 subtasks as complete

The implementation includes two utility functions:
1. `delete_steps_directory()` - Removes the `pr_info/steps/` directory
2. `truncate_task_tracker()` - Truncates TASK_TRACKER.md at the "## Tasks" section

Both functions have proper error handling, logging, and return boolean status. The tests cover all edge cases including missing files/directories and permission errors.

**Commit Message:** 
`feat(create_pr): add utility functions for repository cleanup in step 2`

All CLAUDE.md requirements have been followed - used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
