# Implementation Task: Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_invalid_path_fallback`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_invalid_path_fallback`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me verify the task completion:

## ✅ Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Add test `test_prepare_llm_environment_invalid_path_fallback`

**What was implemented:**
1. ✅ Added the test function `test_prepare_llm_environment_invalid_path_fallback` in `tests/llm/test_env.py:102-122`
2. ✅ Test verifies that when VIRTUAL_ENV points to a non-existent path, the system falls back to CONDA_PREFIX
3. ✅ Test creates a valid conda environment directory and sets VIRTUAL_ENV to `/nonexistent/path/.venv`
4. ✅ Test asserts that the result uses the CONDA_PREFIX path

**Code Quality Verification:**
1. ✅ **Pylint check**: Passed - no issues found
2. ✅ **Pytest check**: Passed - all 1024 tests passed (including the new test)
3. ✅ **Mypy check**: Passed - no type errors found

**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Test name matches specification exactly
- ✅ Test follows the pattern from step_2.5.md
- ✅ Test uses `monkeypatch` for environment variable handling
- ✅ Test creates valid conda environment and invalid VIRTUAL_ENV path
- ✅ Test asserts correct fallback behavior
- ✅ All code quality checks pass
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Commit Message Prepared:**
```
test: add empty VIRTUAL_ENV fallback test

Add test_prepare_llm_environment_invalid_path_fallback to verify that
when VIRTUAL_ENV points to a non-existent path, the system correctly
falls back to CONDA_PREFIX.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively (mcp__filesystem__* and mcp__code-checker__*)
- ✅ Ran all three code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ All checks passed
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved

The task is now complete and ready for the next step in the workflow.
