## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE**: MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md instructions, this blocks all work until resolved.

The MCP tools listed in the instructions are not available in my current environment. I can see from the available tools that I have access to standard Claude Code tools (Read, Write, Edit, etc.) but not the MCP filesystem tools mentioned in CLAUDE.md.

**Available options:**
1. Check if MCP server needs to be started/configured
2. Use standard Claude Code tools (Read, Write, Edit) which are available
3. Wait for user guidance on MCP tool availability

Should I proceed using the standard Claude Code tools (Read, Write, Edit) that are available, or do you need to configure the MCP server first?
