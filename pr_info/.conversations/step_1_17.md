# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I understand now. The MCP pytest tool is running tests using the `mcp_coder_prod` venv Python environment. The issue is that the package needs to be reinstalled in that environment to pick up the new modules.

Since I cannot directly run pip commands without approval, let me inform the user about this situation:

The tests are failing because the recent code changes (Steps 1-4 which added `coordinator.py`, `create_default_config()`, and related functions) need to be installed in the production environment before pytest can import them.

**The issue:** The MCP code-checker tool runs pytest using Python from `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod\.venv\`, but the new code files we created in Steps 1-4 haven't been installed there yet.

**The solution:** We need to reinstall the mcp-coder package. According to the AutoRunner project structure, this should be done using:
```batch
local-windows\setup\reinstall_coder.bat
```

However, I don't have direct access to run this batch script. **Can you please run this command to reinstall the package?**

Alternatively, if you can approve pip commands, I can run:
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

Once the package is reinstalled, the tests should be able to import the coordinator module and all tests should pass.

Would you like me to:
1. Wait for you to run the reinstall script, or
2. Attempt to run the pip install command (which requires approval)?
