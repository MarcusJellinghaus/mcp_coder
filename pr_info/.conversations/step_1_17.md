# Implementation Task: Test dry-run mode prevents API calls

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test dry-run mode prevents API calls

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully implemented and tested the dry-run mode API call prevention for the validate_labels workflow.

### What Was Done

1. **Added comprehensive test** (`test_process_issues_dry_run_prevents_all_api_calls`):
   - Tests that dry-run mode prevents `add_labels()` API calls (for initialization)
   - Tests that dry-run mode prevents `get_issue_events()` API calls (for staleness checking)
   - Verifies bot_busy issues are treated as "OK" in dry-run mode since we can't check staleness
   - Confirms no warnings/errors are generated for bot_busy labels in dry-run mode

2. **Fixed the implementation** in `workflows/validate_labels.py`:
   - Modified the condition from `if category == "bot_busy":` to `if category == "bot_busy" and not dry_run:`
   - This ensures staleness checks (which make API calls) are completely skipped in dry-run mode
   - Updated comment to clarify: "Not a bot_busy label OR dry-run mode, just mark as OK"

3. **Verified all quality checks pass**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors  
   - ✅ Pytest: All 41 tests pass

### Key Implementation Detail

The fix ensures that in dry-run mode, the script:
- Does NOT call `issue_manager.add_labels()` for initialization
- Does NOT call `issue_manager.get_issue_events()` for staleness checking
- Treats all bot_busy labels as "OK" since we can't verify staleness without API calls
- Still provides accurate results for other validation (multiple labels, missing labels)

### Commit Message

```
test(validate-labels): ensure dry-run mode prevents all API calls

Modified process_issues() to skip staleness checks in dry-run mode,
preventing get_issue_events() API calls. Bot_busy labels are treated
as OK during dry-run since staleness cannot be verified without API access.

Added comprehensive test to verify no API calls are made in dry-run mode.
All 41 tests passing.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - MCP tools used exclusively for all operations.
