# Implementation Task: Configure UTF-8 encoding setup in batch script

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Configure UTF-8 encoding setup in batch script

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ Task marked as complete.

## Summary

**Task Completed:** Configure UTF-8 encoding setup in batch script

### What I Found:
The UTF-8 encoding configuration was **already properly configured** in `workflows/issue_stats.bat` at lines 26-29. The implementation includes all required settings:

```batch
REM Set console to UTF-8 codepage to handle Unicode characters
chcp 65001 >nul 2>&1

REM Set Python to use UTF-8 encoding for all I/O operations
set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
set PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING=utf-8
set PYTHONUTF8=1
```

### Verification Results:
✅ **All code quality checks passed:**
- Pytest: 984 tests passed, 4 skipped
- Pylint: No issues found
- Mypy: No type errors found

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
feat(cli): verify UTF-8 encoding in issue_stats.bat

Confirmed UTF-8 encoding configuration is properly set up in batch script:
- chcp 65001 for console code page
- PYTHONIOENCODING, PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING, PYTHONUTF8 environment variables
All configuration matches requirements from step_4.md
```

### Task Status:
- ✅ Main task marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- All CLAUDE.md requirements followed
- Ready for next task: "Configure PYTHONPATH setup in batch script"
