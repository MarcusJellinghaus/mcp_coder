# Implementation Task: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Comprehensive Testing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see - I need user approval for python commands. Let me inform the user about the situation. 

Actually, looking back at the step files and previous steps, the package installation is a prerequisite for running tests after structural changes. The fact that pytest collects 0 tests suggests the package isn't properly installed in the current environment.

Let me document this finding and ask the user to reinstall the package so we can continue with testing:

## Summary of Issue Found

I've discovered that the test files have been properly updated (patch decorators fixed), but pytest cannot collect any tests. This is because:

1. ✅ **Fixed**: Updated patch decorators in `test_file_operations.py`, `test_repository.py`, and `test_prerequisites.py` from `workflows.create_PR` to `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core`

2. ✅ **Deleted**: Removed `test_main.py` which was testing the deleted legacy `workflows/create_PR.py` module (as indicated by its own comments)

3. ❌ **Blocking Issue**: The package needs to be reinstalled in editable mode after structural changes

According to Step 4 in the TASK_TRACKER, tests required "package reinstall" to work properly after the import path changes.

**Required Action**: Please run the following command to reinstall the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

After reinstallation, the tests should be collectable and runnable.

Would you like me to wait for you to reinstall the package, or should I continue with documenting what tests need to be run once the package is reinstalled?
