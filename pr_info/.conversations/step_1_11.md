# Implementation Task: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need permission to write to the test file. Let me wait for user approval.

Since I don't have write permissions yet, let me prepare the exact code that needs to be added. Here's what I'm implementing:

## Working on Step 8: Add Integration Test

I'm adding the `test_env_vars_propagation()` integration test to `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`.

**The test will:**
1. Test CLI method with a simple question to verify env_vars are propagated
2. Test API method with a simple question to verify env_vars are propagated
3. Assert both methods execute successfully (proving env_vars reached the Claude Code subprocess/SDK)

**Implementation:**
```python
@pytest.mark.claude_cli_integration
def test_env_vars_propagation() -> None:
    """Verify env_vars propagate to Claude Code in both CLI and API methods.

    This is a real integration test that makes actual API calls to verify
    environment variables are correctly set and accessible.
    """
    # Test CLI method - env_vars should be automatically prepared and passed
    result_cli = ask_llm(
        "Yes or no: Is 3+3=6?",
        provider="claude",
        method="cli",
        timeout=60,
    )
    assert isinstance(result_cli, str)
    assert len(result_cli) > 0
    assert "yes" in result_cli.lower()

    # Test API method - env_vars should be automatically prepared and passed
    result_api = ask_llm(
        "Yes or no: Is 4+4=8?",
        provider="claude",
        method="api",
        timeout=60,
    )
    assert isinstance(result_api, str)
    assert len(result_api) > 0
    assert "yes" in result_api.lower()
```

This will be inserted before the final comments in the file.

Waiting for file write permission to proceed...
