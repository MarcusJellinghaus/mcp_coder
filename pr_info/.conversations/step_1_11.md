# Implementation Task: Create `tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py` (step_4.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py` (step_4.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
No conftest.py interfering. OK, I'm going to ask the user for help. But wait, let me try running pytest using Bash to see if it works outside of the MCP tool:

Actually, I just need to get user approval for bash commands. Let me provide a summary of the issue and ask them to help me run pytest manually to see if it works.

**Issue Summary:**

I've successfully created the test file `tests/cli/commands/test_create_plan.py` with the required test class and methods according to step_4.md. However, when running pytest through the MCP code-checker tool, it's collecting 0 tests from this file, even though:

1. The file exists and can be read
2. Mypy finds no type errors in the file
3. Pylint can analyze it (though it reports an import issue)
4. Other test files in the same directory (like test_commit.py and test_implement.py) ARE being discovered

I need to run pytest manually through Bash to verify whether this is an MCP tool configuration issue or a real problem with the test file. Can you approve the bash command to run pytest directly?
