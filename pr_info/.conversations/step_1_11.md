# Implementation Task: Add private helper function `_get_runner_environment()` with validation logic

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add private helper function `_get_runner_environment()` with validation logic

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete.

## Summary

**✅ TASK COMPLETED: Add private helper function `_get_runner_environment()` with validation logic**

### What was implemented:

1. **Added `_get_runner_environment()` helper function** in `src/mcp_coder/llm/env.py:14-43`:
   - Returns `tuple[str, str]` with (environment_path, source_name)
   - Handles empty string environment variables with `.strip()`
   - Validates path existence with `Path(path).exists()`
   - Logs warnings for invalid paths before fallback
   - Priority chain: VIRTUAL_ENV → CONDA_PREFIX → sys.prefix

2. **Updated `prepare_llm_environment()` function** in `src/mcp_coder/llm/env.py:63-68`:
   - Uses new helper function
   - Captures both path and source name
   - Enhanced logging to show which source was used

### Code Quality Verification:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found  
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 1022 tests pass

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
refactor: add _get_runner_environment() helper with validation (Step 2.5)

Add private helper function to encapsulate runner environment detection
with robust validation logic:
- Handle empty environment variable strings with .strip()
- Validate path existence before returning
- Log warnings for invalid paths and fallback to next option
- Return tuple of (path, source_name) for clear logging
- Update prepare_llm_environment() to use new helper

All tests pass (1022 passed).
```

**✅ All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations
- Ran all three code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- All checks passed
- Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
