# Implementation Task: Implement build_label_lookups() to create lookup structures

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement build_label_lookups() to create lookup structures

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

**Task completed successfully!** ✅

I have implemented the `build_label_lookups()` function for Step 3 of the validate labels workflow.

### What was implemented:

**Code Changes:**
- **workflows/validate_labels.py:42-77**: Added `build_label_lookups()` function that creates four lookup structures from label configuration:
  - `id_to_name`: Maps internal_id → label_name
  - `all_names`: Set of all workflow label names
  - `name_to_category`: Maps label_name → category
  - `name_to_id`: Maps label_name → internal_id

**Tests Added:**
- **tests/workflows/test_validate_labels.py**: Added 4 comprehensive test functions:
  - `test_build_label_lookups()`: Normal operation with multiple labels
  - `test_build_label_lookups_empty_config()`: Edge case with empty config
  - `test_build_label_lookups_single_label()`: Single label verification
  - `test_build_label_lookups_all_categories()`: All category types and bidirectional mappings

### Verification Results:
✅ **Pylint**: No issues found  
✅ **Pytest**: All 16 tests pass in test_validate_labels.py  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors  

### Commit Message (prepared, not executed):
```
feat(validate-labels): implement build_label_lookups() for label configuration

Add build_label_lookups() function that creates lookup dictionaries from
label configuration JSON. Returns LabelLookups TypedDict with four lookup
structures: id_to_name, all_names, name_to_category, and name_to_id.

Includes comprehensive unit tests covering normal operation, empty config,
single label, and all category types with bidirectional mapping verification.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
```

### Task Status:
- ✅ Task marked as complete in pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md
- ✅ All CLAUDE.md requirements followed (MCP tools used, all quality checks passed)

The implementation is ready for the next task in the workflow!
