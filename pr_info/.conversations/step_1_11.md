## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ALERT: MCP Server Issues Detected**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible. According to CLAUDE.md requirements, this blocks all work until resolved.

**Issue:** `mcp__filesystem__read_file` tool is not available
**Impact:** Cannot proceed with file operations as required by project instructions

Please resolve the MCP server configuration issue before I can continue with the task. The MCP tools must be accessible to follow the mandatory project requirements.
