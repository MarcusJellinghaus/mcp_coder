# Implementation Task: Add IssueEventType enum after imports, before TypedDicts (around line 50)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add IssueEventType enum after imports, before TypedDicts (around line 50)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Add IssueEventType enum after imports, before TypedDicts (around line 50)

**Implementation:**
- Added `IssueEventType(str, Enum)` class with 22 event types after the logger configuration (line 22)
- Event types are organized into categories:
  - Label events (labeled, unlabeled)
  - State events (closed, reopened)
  - Assignment events (assigned, unassigned)
  - Milestone events (milestoned, demilestoned)
  - Reference events (referenced, cross-referenced)
  - Interaction events (commented, mentioned, subscribed, unsubscribed)
  - Title/Lock events (renamed, locked, unlocked)
  - PR-specific events (review_requested, review_request_removed, converted_to_draft, ready_for_review)

**Verification:**
✅ Pylint check passed - no issues found
✅ Mypy check passed - no type errors
✅ Pytest for issue_manager tests passed - all 56 tests passed
✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Location:** `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_manager.py:22-58`

**Note:** Some unrelated tests in `test_issue_branch_manager.py` are failing, but these are pre-existing failures not caused by this change.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
