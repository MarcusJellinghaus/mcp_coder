# Implementation Task: Part B: Implement CLI Command (GREEN Phase)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Part B: Implement CLI Command (GREEN Phase)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I've encountered a virtual environment configuration issue. The MCP code-checker is using a virtual environment from `C:\\Users\\Marcus\\Documents\\GitHub\\AutoRunner\\mcp_coder_prod\\.venv\\`, but I'm working in `C:\\Users\\Marcus\\Documents\\GitHub\\AutoRunner\\Code\\mcp_coder\\`.

The pytest cannot find the `mcp_coder.cli.commands.create_pr` module I created because the installed package in that virtual environment is not seeing the files in my working directory.

**Possible causes:**
1. The `mcp-coder` package in `mcp_coder_prod\.venv` is installed from a different source directory than where I'm working
2. The `.mcp.json` environment variables (`${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}` and `${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}`) might be pointing to the wrong locations
3. The editable install needs to be refreshed

**What I've done so far:**
✓ Created `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_pr.py` with the `execute_create_pr()` function  
✓ Created stub workflow package at `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_pr/core.py`  
✓ Verified files exist in the filesystem  
✗ Cannot import the module in pytest  

**Question:** Could you help me understand the environment setup? Should I:

**A) Work in a different directory**  
- Maybe I should be editing files in a `mcp_coder_prod` directory instead of `Code/mcp_coder`?  
- The pytest path suggests there's a `mcp_coder_prod` directory at the AutoRunner root level  

**B) Fix the virtual environment configuration**  
- Update `.mcp.json` to point to the correct project directory  
- Reinstall the package in the virtual environment  

**C) Use the current working directory correctly**  
- The setup is correct, but I need to trigger a package refresh somehow  
- Maybe there's a specific command to run  

Which approach should I take to resolve this environment issue?
