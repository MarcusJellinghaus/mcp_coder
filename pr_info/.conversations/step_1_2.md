# Implementation Task: Implement `generate_branch_name_from_issue()` utility function

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement `generate_branch_name_from_issue()` utility function

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## ✅ Task Complete!

**Successfully implemented: `generate_branch_name_from_issue()` utility function**

### Implementation Summary

**File**: `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_branch_manager.py:5`

**What was implemented**:
- ✅ Branch name sanitization function following GitHub's native rules
- ✅ Handles " - " → "---" conversion (GitHub-specific)
- ✅ Converts to lowercase, replaces special chars with dashes
- ✅ Collapses multiple dashes while preserving "---"
- ✅ Strips leading/trailing dashes
- ✅ Truncates to max_length (default 200) preserving issue number
- ✅ Handles edge cases: empty titles, Unicode, emojis, special characters

### Code Quality Results
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues
- ✅ **Pytest**: 134 tests passed (including all 21 branch name generation tests)
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors

### Commit Message Prepared
```
feat(issue-branch): implement branch name sanitization utility

Implement generate_branch_name_from_issue() function with GitHub-compliant
branch name sanitization:
- Replace " - " with "---" (GitHub-specific rule)
- Convert to lowercase and replace special chars with dashes
- Collapse multiple dashes while preserving "---"
- Strip leading/trailing dashes
- Truncate to max_length (default 200) preserving issue number

All 21 test cases pass including edge cases for Unicode, emojis, 
special characters, and empty titles.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**: Used MCP tools exclusively for all file operations and code quality checks.
