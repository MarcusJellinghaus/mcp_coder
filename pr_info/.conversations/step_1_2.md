# Implementation Task: Copy `workflows/create_plan.py` to `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_plan.py` (step_2a.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Copy `workflows/create_plan.py` to `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_plan.py` (step_2a.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All tasks have been completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

---

## ✅ Task Completed: Step 2a - Copy Workflow File to New Location

### What was done:

1. **File copied successfully** ✅
   - Source: `workflows/create_plan.py`
   - Destination: `src/mcp_coder/workflows/create_plan.py`
   - File size: 21,485 characters

2. **Content verification** ✅
   - Both files have identical content (exact copy)
   - No modifications were made to the code
   - All functions, imports, and structure preserved exactly

3. **Commit message prepared** ✅
   - `feat(workflows): copy create_plan.py to new package location`

4. **Task tracker updated** ✅
   - All Step 2a checkboxes marked as complete `[x]`
   - Ready for next step (Step 2b)

### Important notes:

- **This is an exact copy** - No code changes were made
- **Import issues expected** - The copied file will have import path issues, which is normal and will be fixed in Step 2d
- **Original file preserved** - The original `workflows/create_plan.py` remains unchanged and will be deleted in Step 7

### Next step:

The next task is **Step 2b: Refactor Main Function Signature** which will:
- Rename `main()` to `run_create_plan_workflow()`
- Update function signature with 4 parameters
- Change return type from None to int
- Remove argument parsing and other CLI-specific code

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations.
