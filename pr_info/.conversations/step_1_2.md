# Implementation Task: Implement `create_default_config()` in `src/mcp_coder/utils/user_config.py` (see step_1.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement `create_default_config()` in `src/mcp_coder/utils/user_config.py` (see step_1.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Completed Successfully! ✅

I have successfully implemented Step 1 of the coordinator test feature. Here's a summary:

### What Was Implemented:
**File**: `src/mcp_coder/utils/user_config.py`

Added the `create_default_config()` function that:
- Creates `~/.mcp_coder/config.toml` with template configuration
- Includes Jenkins server settings (server_url, username, api_token)
- Includes example repository configurations (mcp_coder, mcp_server_filesystem)
- Returns `True` on successful creation, `False` if config already exists
- Raises `OSError` if directory/file creation fails due to permissions

### Verification Results:
✅ **All tests pass** (1007/1007 tests passed)
✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
✅ **Pytest**: All tests passed including the 6 new tests for `create_default_config`
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors

### Commit Message Prepared:
```
feat: implement create_default_config in user_config.py

Add create_default_config() function to automatically generate
configuration template on first run. Function creates
~/.mcp_coder/config.toml with example Jenkins and repository
configurations, enabling easy setup for coordinator test command.
```

### Task Tracker Updated:
✅ All Step 1 tasks marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
