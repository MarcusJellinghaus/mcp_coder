# Implementation Task: Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_conda_prefix`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_conda_prefix`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! ✅ The task has been successfully marked as complete. 

## Task Completion Summary

**Task Implemented:** Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_conda_prefix`

### What Was Done:

1. ✅ **Added the new test** to `tests/llm/test_env.py:29-50`
   - Test verifies that `CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable is used when `VIRTUAL_ENV` is not set
   - Creates temporary conda environment directory
   - Mocks environment variables to clear `VIRTUAL_ENV` and set `CONDA_PREFIX`
   - Asserts the function returns the conda environment path

2. ✅ **Code Quality Checks Passed:**
   - **Pylint**: No issues found
   - **Pytest**: Test fails as expected (TDD RED phase) - this is correct behavior
   - **Mypy**: No type errors

3. ✅ **Task Marked Complete** in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Expected Behavior (TDD RED Phase):

The test currently **fails** (as expected) because:
- The implementation still uses the old `detect_python_environment()` logic
- Step 2 will update the implementation to use environment variables
- This is the correct TDD RED phase behavior

### Commit Message Prepared:

```
test(env): add test for CONDA_PREFIX detection

Add test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_conda_prefix to verify that
CONDA_PREFIX environment variable is used as fallback when VIRTUAL_ENV
is not set. This is part of TDD RED phase - test currently fails as
expected until implementation is updated in Step 2.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
