# Implementation Task: Implement `workflows/create_plan.py` - Main workflow script with argument parsing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement `workflows/create_plan.py` - Main workflow script with argument parsing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me now verify the task completion and prepare a commit message as specified in the workflow:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the task: **Implement `workflows/create_plan.py` - Main workflow script with argument parsing**

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `workflows/create_plan.py`** (workflows/create_plan.py:1) with:
   - `parse_arguments()` function (workflows/create_plan.py:21) - Parses CLI arguments for issue_number (required), project_dir, log_level, and llm_method
   - `resolve_project_dir()` function (workflows/create_plan.py:50) - Validates and resolves project directory with full validation (exists, is_dir, accessible, contains .git)
   - `main()` function (workflows/create_plan.py:95) - Main workflow orchestration (placeholder for future steps)
   - Proper imports and logging setup following the exact pattern from `create_PR.py`

2. **Test file already existed**: `tests/workflows/create_plan/test_argument_parsing.py` with comprehensive test coverage (23 tests)

3. **All code quality checks passed**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No errors or fatal issues
   - ✅ Pytest: 23 tests passed
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

4. **Marked task complete** in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

### Key implementation details:

- **Issue number**: Required positional argument (type=int)
- **Default llm_method**: `claude_code_cli` (as specified in requirements)
- **Validation**: Full validation of project directory including .git check
- **Pattern compliance**: Follows exact same structure as `create_PR.py`
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages and sys.exit(1) on validation failures

### Commit message (prepared but not executed):

```
feat(create-plan): implement main workflow script with argument parsing - Step 1

Add workflows/create_plan.py with argument parsing and project directory validation.

Key features:
- parse_arguments() with issue_number (required), project_dir, log_level, llm_method
- resolve_project_dir() with full validation (exists, is_dir, .git check)
- main() orchestration function (placeholder for future steps)
- Default llm_method: claude_code_cli
- Comprehensive test coverage (23 tests, all passing)
- All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations
- ✅ All code quality checks passed using correct MCP tool names
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
