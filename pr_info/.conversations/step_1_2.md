## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add get_branch_diff() function to src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll start by examining the TASK_TRACKER.md to understand the current task and then implement it.I can see that the current task is "Add get_branch_diff() function to src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py". The tests have already been written, so I need to implement the function. Let me first look at the existing tests to understand the requirements.Let me read the file in parts, focusing on the get_branch_diff tests:Now let me look at the existing git_operations.py file to understand the structure and see what's already there:I can see the file already exists and I need to implement the `get_branch_diff()` function. Let me check what functions are imported from git_operations.py in the test file to ensure I'm implementing the right one:Let me check the imports more carefully:Let me use TodoWrite to track the task:Now, let me check the imports section of the test file to see what functions are being imported:Good! I can see that `get_branch_diff` is indeed imported in the test file. Looking at the existing implementation in git_operations.py, I can see that the function is already implemented! Let me verify the implementation is complete by checking if it matches the test requirements:Let me see the rest of the implementation:Perfect! The `get_branch_diff()` function is already fully implemented. Let me now run the code quality checks to ensure everything passes:Now let's run pylint check:Good! Pylint check passed. Now let's update the todo and run pytest:Now run the pytest check - I'll run only the fast unit tests related to get_branch_diff:Great! All the get_branch_diff tests are passing. Now let's run mypy:Let me check these specific lines to understand the mypy issues:Now let me check around line 903 and 1081 more closely:Let me check lines around 903 and 1081:I can see that the `get_branch_diff()` function is already fully implemented in the file. The mypy errors are on lines 903 and 1081. Let me check those specific lines:Let me use grep to find the issue:Now let me look at line 1081 in the get_branch_diff function:The mypy issues are minor - they're related to GitPython's typing. Let me check the exact type that GitPython returns:Let me fix these type issues by adding explicit type casts:Now fix the second occurrence:Now let's fix the line 1081 issue in get_branch_diff:Now let's run mypy again to verify the fixes:We still have one more issue. Let me fix that:Let me fix this last occurrence:Now let's run all checks again to ensure everything passes:Let me check line 904 more carefully:Let me try a different approach:I see the issue. The mypy error is still pointing to line 904. Let me look at the actual current state after our edits:It seems line 904 is likely from the symbolic-ref line. Let me check what's on line 904:I see line 904 is the return statement after `result.replace`. The issue is that `repo.git.symbolic_ref()` returns an `Any` type according to GitPython's typing. Let's fix this:Now let's run all the checks again to ensure everything passes:Excellent! All checks are passing. Let me update the task tracker to mark the current task as complete and update the todo list:Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md file to mark the completed tasks:Perfect! I have successfully completed Step 1 of the implementation. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Task Completed: Add get_branch_diff() function to src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations.py

### What was implemented:
The `get_branch_diff()` function was already present in the codebase. I fixed minor type annotation issues to ensure full compliance with mypy's strict type checking.

### Changes made:
1. Fixed mypy type issues by adding explicit `str()` casts for GitPython return values
2. Ensured all code quality checks pass

### Verification completed:
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Pytest: All 7 get_branch_diff tests passed  
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

### Commit message suggestion:
```
fix: resolve mypy type annotations in git_operations.py

- Add explicit str() casts for GitPython command returns
- Ensure get_branch_diff() passes strict type checking
- All tests and code quality checks pass
```

The implementation is ready. All CLAUDE.md requirements have been followed - I used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
