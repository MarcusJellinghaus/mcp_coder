Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I see the confusion. Looking at the TASK_TRACKER.md, the next incomplete tasks are preparing commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8. However, you mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" which doesn't match any task I can find.

Let me check if perhaps you're referring to a different task document or if there's been a misunderstanding:

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION NEEDED ðŸš¨**

Based on my analysis of the task tracker at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`, I cannot find a task titled "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions". 

What I found:
- All implementation steps (Steps 1-8) are **complete** with code and tests passing
- The `workflows/implement/core.py` file is already fully implemented (Step 5 is complete)
- The only incomplete tasks are:
  - Preparing git commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8
  - Final PR review tasks

**Could you please clarify:**
1. Are you referring to a specific task I'm missing?
2. Is there a different task tracker or document I should be looking at?
3. Or did you mean one of the commit message preparation tasks?

Please provide the exact task description or point me to the correct location so I can proceed with the right implementation.
