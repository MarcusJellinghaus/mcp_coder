## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the next task from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Let me first read the task tracker to understand what needs to be done.I can see that the current task is "Git commit preparation and commit" for Step 1. Let me also check the test readme to understand the testing context.Now let me use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track this specific task:Let me first check the current git status and what changes have been made:It appears the working tree is clean, which means the Step 1 changes have already been committed. Let me check the recent commit history to see what was committed:Perfect! I can see that the most recent commit "feat: move mcp-code-checker to main deps and add mypy fix prompt" appears to be the Step 1 implementation. Let me verify this by checking what changes were included in that commit:Excellent! The commit includes exactly the files that should have been changed for Step 1:
- `pyproject.toml` (moved mcp-code-checker to main dependencies)
- `src/mcp_coder/prompts/prompts.md` (added mypy fix prompt)
- Plus task tracker updates

Let me also verify the contents of these changes to ensure they match the Step 1 requirements:Perfect! I can confirm that Step 1 has been fully completed and already committed with the commit "feat: move mcp-code-checker to main deps and add mypy fix prompt". The changes include:

1. ✅ Moved `mcp-code-checker` from dev dependencies to main dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
2. ✅ Added the "Mypy Fix Prompt" section to `src/mcp_coder/prompts/prompts.md`
3. ✅ The commit message follows the requested format with the step name in the title

Now I need to update the task tracker to mark this task as complete:Perfect! I have successfully completed the "Git commit preparation and commit" task for Step 1. 

## Summary

✅ **Task Completed**: Git commit preparation and commit for Step 1

The task was already completed with commit `4b0f783` titled "feat: move mcp-code-checker to main deps and add mypy fix prompt". This commit included:

1. **pyproject.toml**: Moved `mcp-code-checker` from dev dependencies to main dependencies
2. **src/mcp_coder/prompts/prompts.md**: Added the "Mypy Fix Prompt" section
3. **Task tracker updates**: Updated progress tracking files

The commit message follows the requested format with the step name in the title, and I've updated the task tracker to mark this task as complete.

**Step 1 is now fully complete** - all implementation steps have been finished, quality checks have passed, and the changes have been committed. The next step (Step 2: Complete Mypy Integration) is now ready to be worked on.
