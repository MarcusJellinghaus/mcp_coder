# Implementation Task: Add module docstring to `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/label_config.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add module docstring to `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/label_config.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All tasks in Step 7 have been marked as complete with `[x]` checkboxes. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Task:** Add module docstring to `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/label_config.py`

### Summary of Changes:

1. **Added comprehensive module docstring** that includes:
   - Description of the module's purpose (loading and parsing GitHub label configurations)
   - Support for both local project overrides and bundled package configurations
   - Typical usage pattern with example code
   - Explanation of fallback behavior (local → bundled config)

### Verification Results:

✅ **Pylint check:** No issues found  
✅ **Mypy check:** No type errors found  
✅ **Pytest check:** All 1121 tests passed  
✅ **No code logic changes:** Only documentation was modified  
✅ **Task tracker updated:** All Step 7 tasks marked complete  

### Prepared Commit Message:

```
docs(label_config): add comprehensive module docstring

Add detailed module docstring to label_config.py explaining:
- Purpose and usage pattern
- Example code for typical usage
- Fallback behavior (local → bundled config)

Part of Step 7 code review follow-up.
```

### All CLAUDE.md Requirements Followed:

✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively (`mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)  
✅ Used MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)  
✅ All code quality checks passed  
✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md  

**Status:** Ready for next task or commit.
