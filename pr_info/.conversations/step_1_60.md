# Implementation Task: Verify complete workflow (jobs triggered, labels updated)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify complete workflow (jobs triggered, labels updated)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All CLAUDE.md requirements have been followed. Let me provide a final summary:

## ✅ Task Complete: Verify Complete Workflow

I have successfully verified the complete workflow implementation for Step 6. Here's what was accomplished:

### Verification Results

**1. Complete Workflow ✅**
- Verified `test_end_to_end_single_repo_multiple_issues` confirms:
  - 3 Jenkins jobs triggered correctly
  - Labels updated with correct transitions (08→09, 05→06, 02→03)
  - Proper workflow commands dispatched (create-pr, implement, create-plan)

**2. Priority Ordering ✅**
- Verified `test_end_to_end_priority_ordering` confirms:
  - Issues processed in priority order: status-08 → status-05 → status-02
  - Works correctly even when issues returned in random order

**3. Filtering Logic ✅**
- Verified `test_end_to_end_ignore_labels_filtering` confirms:
  - Issues with ignore labels excluded (only 2/3 issues processed)
  - Correct issues dispatched, ignored issue skipped

**4. Fail-Fast Behavior ✅**
- Verified two fail-fast scenarios:
  - `test_end_to_end_fail_fast_on_jenkins_error`: Stops on Jenkins failure
  - `test_end_to_end_fail_fast_on_missing_branch`: Stops on missing branch
  - Both return exit code 1 and halt processing

**5. Code Quality Checks ✅**
- Pylint: No issues found
- Pytest: All 1121 tests pass (including 53 coordinator tests)
- Mypy: No type errors

### Commit Message Prepared

```
test(coordinator): verify comprehensive integration testing

Verified complete end-to-end workflow implementation:

- Complete workflow: Jobs triggered and labels updated correctly
- Priority ordering: Issues processed in order 08 → 05 → 02
- Filtering logic: Ignore labels exclude issues properly
- Fail-fast behavior: Stops on Jenkins errors and missing branches
- All 53 coordinator tests pass
- All 1121 unit tests pass
- Code quality: Pylint, pytest, and mypy all pass
```

### CLAUDE.md Compliance ✅

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively (mcp__code-checker__* tools)
- ✅ Used mcp__filesystem__* tools for file operations
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Fast unit tests executed with proper exclusions
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The verification task is now complete and ready for the next step in the workflow!
