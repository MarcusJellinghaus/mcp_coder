# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_all_issues_have_bot_busy_labels()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_all_issues_have_bot_busy_labels()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete. Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Complete ✅

**Task:** Write test: `test_all_issues_have_bot_busy_labels()`

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Test Added:** `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:3735-3851`
   - Added `test_all_issues_have_bot_busy_labels()` to `TestCoordinatorRunEdgeCases` class
   - Creates 3 mock issues with bot_busy labels: status-03:planning, status-06:implementing, status-09:pr-creating
   - Verifies no workflows are dispatched when all issues are already being processed
   - Verifies exit code 0 (success - not an error condition)
   - Verifies no label updates occur

2. **Code Quality Verification:**
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Pytest: All 1120 tests pass (including the new test)
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors (all IssueData fields properly populated)

3. **Task Tracker Updated:**
   - Main task marked as complete: `[x] Write test: test_all_issues_have_bot_busy_labels()`

**Commit Message (prepared):**
```
test(coordinator): add bot_busy labels edge case test

Add test_all_issues_have_bot_busy_labels() to verify behavior when all
open issues are already being processed (have bot_busy labels). Ensures
no workflows are dispatched and function returns success.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
