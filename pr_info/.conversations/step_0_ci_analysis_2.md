# CI Failure Analysis

The pylint CI job failed due to a Python version compatibility issue in `src/mcp_coder/utils/folder_deletion.py` at line 192. The code uses the `onexc` keyword argument for `shutil.rmtree()`, which was introduced in Python 3.12. However, the CI environment runs Python 3.11.14, which does not recognize this parameter, causing pylint to report error E1123 (unexpected-keyword-arg).

The `_try_rmtree` function in `folder_deletion.py` already contains version-checking logic that attempts to use `onexc` for Python 3.12+ and fall back to the deprecated `onerror` for earlier versions. However, the pylint disable comment `# pylint: disable=unexpected-keyword-arg` on line 192 is insufficient because pylint performs static analysis without runtime version checking. Pylint analyzes the code against the Python version it's running under (3.11), and since `onexc` doesn't exist in Python 3.11's `shutil.rmtree()` signature, it flags this as an error regardless of the runtime conditional.

The fix requires adjusting the pylint configuration or the code structure to prevent pylint from flagging the `onexc` argument as invalid. Options include: (1) adding the error code to pylint's disabled checks in the project configuration, (2) restructuring the code to avoid the version-specific call path that pylint cannot understand, or (3) using a more specific inline pylint disable directive that works correctly. The most maintainable approach would be to ensure the pylint disable comment properly suppresses the E1123 error, or to refactor the version-conditional logic in a way that pylint can handle during static analysis.
