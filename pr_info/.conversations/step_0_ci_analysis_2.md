# CI Failure Analysis

The CI pipeline unit-tests job failed because the newly added vscodeclaude module files are not installed in the virtual environment. The source code contains `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator/vscodeclaude.py` and `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator/vscodeclaude_templates.py`, along with their corresponding test file `tests/cli/commands/coordinator/test_vscodeclaude.py`. However, the installed package in the virtual environment only contains the older coordinator files (core.py, commands.py, command_templates.py, workflow_constants.py, __init__.py) - the new vscodeclaude modules are missing from the installation.

When pytest runs, it attempts to import from `mcp_coder.cli.commands.coordinator.vscodeclaude` but fails because these files don't exist in the installed package location (`.venv/Lib/site-packages/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator/`). This causes the test collection to fail with an import error, which manifests as a pytest usage error rather than a clear import failure.

To fix this issue, the package needs to be reinstalled so the new source files are copied to the virtual environment. This can be done by running `uv sync` or `pip install -e .` to perform an editable install, or by running the CI pipeline's package installation step again. The coordinator `__init__.py` may also need to be updated to export the new vscodeclaude functions if they should be part of the public API. No code changes to the vscodeclaude.py or test_vscodeclaude.py files themselves are required - the implementation is complete, it simply needs to be properly installed.
