Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add integration test `test_env_vars_propagation()` in `tests/llm/providers/claude/test_claude_integration.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: MCP Server Issues Detected**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible (`mcp__filesystem__read_file` is unavailable). This blocks all work until resolved. 

Please check:
1. Is the MCP server running?
2. Are the MCP tools properly configured in `.mcp.json`?
3. Is there a connection issue with the MCP server?

I cannot proceed with the task until the MCP tools are available, as per CLAUDE.md requirements.
