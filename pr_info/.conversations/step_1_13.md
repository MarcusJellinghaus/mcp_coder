# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The reinstall script requires approval. This is a critical step that I cannot proceed without. Let me inform the user about this situation and ask for their help.

Based on my investigation, I've identified the issue:

## Current Status

The test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` and source file `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` **already exist** and are properly implemented. However, pytest cannot run the tests because:

**Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations'`

**Root Cause:** The new `jenkins_operations` submodule exists in the source code but is not recognized by Python because the package hasn't been reinstalled in editable mode after adding the new module.

**Solution Required:** Run the `tools/reinstall.bat` script to reinstall the package so Python can recognize the new module.

## What I Need

I need approval to run the following command:
```bash
./tools/reinstall.bat
```

This script will:
1. Uninstall existing packages
2. Reinstall `mcp-coder` in development mode with `pip install -e .`
3. Install development dependencies
4. Verify the installation

Once this is done, the pytest tests will be able to import the new module and run successfully.

## Alternative

If you prefer, you can run the reinstall script manually in your terminal before I continue with the quality checks.

Would you like me to:
1. Wait for you to run `tools\reinstall.bat` manually, or
2. Proceed with the command that requires approval?
