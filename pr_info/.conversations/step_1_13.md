## Current Situation

All tasks in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` are **already completed** (implementation + checks passed). The only pending items are:

1. **Commit messages** for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8 (marked as `[ ]`)
2. **Final Review and PR submission** (all items marked as `[ ]`)

There is **no task** in the tracker about "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" as you mentioned.

## Questions for you:

1. **Are you referring to a different task tracker?** If so, please provide the path.

2. **Do you want me to work on the next incomplete item**, which would be preparing commit messages for the completed steps?

3. **Is there a new task** about implementing core.py that hasn't been added to the tracker yet? If so, please clarify what needs to be implemented.

4. **Should I proceed with the final review and PR preparation** since all implementation is complete?
