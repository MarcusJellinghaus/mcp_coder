Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the task tracker to understand the next task and implement it step by step.Now let me check the current implementation to understand what needs to be done for the `merge_pull_request` method:Now let me check the test file to understand what the expected behavior should be:Now let me check the tests/README.md to understand which tests I should run:I'll create a todo list to track the implementation of the `merge_pull_request` method and then implement it step by step.Now I'll implement the `merge_pull_request` method. Based on the existing pattern in the code and the test expectations, I need to implement a method that merges a pull request and returns detailed result information.Now I'll implement the `merge_pull_request` method. Let me look at the GitHub API documentation pattern from the other methods and implement it:Let me fix the parameter format:Now let me update the todo list to mark the first task as completed and move to the next one:Now let me run the pylint checks:Great! Now let me update the todo list and run pytest checks:Now let me run the pytest checks, but only for unit tests to avoid slow integration tests as mentioned in the instructions:Great! Now let me update the todo list and run mypy checks:Perfect! Now let me mark the final todo as completed:Now let me verify that my implementation matches what was required by checking the task tracker again and updating it:## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `merge_pull_request` method with result details. Here's what was accomplished:

**Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement merge_pull_request with result details** ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details:

1. **Added comprehensive merge functionality** that:
   - Retrieves the pull request using GitHub API
   - Checks if the PR is mergeable before attempting merge
   - Handles already-merged PRs gracefully
   - Performs the actual merge operation
   - Returns detailed result information including merge status, message, SHA, and PR number

2. **Error handling** with proper exception catching for:
   - GitHub API exceptions
   - General exceptions
   - Returns empty dict on failures as per the established pattern

3. **All code quality checks passed**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Pytest: 400/470 tests passed (unit tests only, avoiding slow integration tests)
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors found

### Commit Message:
`feat(github): implement merge_pull_request with result details`

The implementation follows the existing code patterns in the class, includes proper error handling, type hints, logging decorator, and returns structured data consistent with other methods in the PullRequestManager class.
