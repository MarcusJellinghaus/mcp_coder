# Implementation Task: Update Integration Tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update Integration Tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The command needs approval. Let me ask the user directly:

The integration tests are failing because the `mcp-coder` package needs to be reinstalled to pick up the changes to `src/mcp_coder/workflows/__init__.py`. 

The source files have been correctly updated:
- ✅ All imports in `tests/workflows/test_create_pr_integration.py` have been updated from `workflows.create_PR` to `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core`
- ✅ The `src/mcp_coder/workflows/__init__.py` file has been updated to import the `create_pr` subpackage
- ✅ All code quality checks (pylint, mypy) pass on the updated files

However, the installed package in the `mcp_coder_prod` venv still has the old version of `workflows/__init__.py` without the `create_pr` import, which is why pytest can't resolve the module path for the `@patch` decorators.

**To fix this, please approve the following command:**
```bash
pip install -e . --force-reinstall --no-deps
```

This will reinstall the mcp-coder package in editable mode without touching dependencies, which will refresh the package structure and allow Python to properly import `mcp_coder.workflows.create_pr.core`.

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can run this command manually in the `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\Code\mcp_coder` directory.

Once the package is reinstalled, the integration tests should pass.
