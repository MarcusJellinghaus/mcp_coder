## Summary

I have successfully completed **Step 10: Add integration tests for error handling scenarios**.

### What was implemented:

Added three comprehensive integration test methods in `tests/utils/test_issue_manager_integration.py`:

1. **`test_error_handling_invalid_issue_numbers`** - Tests operations on non-existent or invalid issue numbers (negative, zero, very high numbers)
   - Tests all issue operations (close, reopen, add_labels, remove_labels, set_labels, add_comment, get_comments)
   - Verifies that empty/default data structures are returned instead of crashes

2. **`test_error_handling_invalid_comments`** - Tests comment operations with invalid data
   - Non-existent comment IDs for edit/delete operations
   - Invalid comment IDs (negative, zero)
   - Empty or whitespace-only comment bodies
   - Verifies original data remains unchanged when operations fail

3. **`test_error_handling_invalid_input`** - Tests operations with invalid input data
   - Empty or whitespace-only issue titles
   - Verifies normal operations still work after error cases

### Quality checks:
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors (fixed type inference issues with variable names)
- ✅ Pytest: Fast unit tests passed, GitHub integration tests passed (2 passed, 11 skipped)

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.

```
test(issue-manager): add integration tests for error handling scenarios

Add comprehensive error handling integration tests covering:
- Invalid issue numbers (non-existent, negative, zero)
- Invalid comment IDs and empty comment bodies
- Invalid input data (empty titles, whitespace-only input)

Tests verify graceful error handling with empty/default return values
rather than crashes, ensuring robust API behavior.
```
