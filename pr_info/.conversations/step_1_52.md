# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_end_to_end_ignore_labels_filtering()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_end_to_end_ignore_labels_filtering()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## ✅ TASK COMPLETE

**Summary:**

I have successfully implemented the test `test_end_to_end_ignore_labels_filtering()` in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`.

**What was implemented:**

1. **Test Structure**: Added comprehensive integration test that verifies ignore_labels filtering
2. **Test Scenario**: 
   - 3 issues total (101, 102, 103)
   - Issue #102 has both "status-05:plan-ready" AND "Overview" label
   - "Overview" is in the ignore_labels list
3. **Verification**:
   - Only 2 jobs dispatched (issues 101 and 103)
   - Issue #102 with "Overview" label is excluded
   - Correct workflows dispatched for eligible issues
   - Correct label transitions for eligible issues only
   - Issue #102 receives no label updates

**Code Quality Checks - ALL PASSED ✅:**
- ✅ Pytest: 1115 tests passed (fast unit tests)
- ✅ Pylint: No issues found
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors

**TASK_TRACKER.md Updated:**
- ✅ Marked `test_end_to_end_ignore_labels_filtering()` as complete `[x]`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The test is now ready and validates that issues with ignore labels (like "Overview") are properly filtered out from the coordinator workflow processing.
