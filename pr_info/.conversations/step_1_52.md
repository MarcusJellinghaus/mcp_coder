# Implementation Task: Update `tests/cli/commands/test_create_pr.py`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update `tests/cli/commands/test_create_pr.py`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need user approval for pip commands. Let me explain the situation to you:

The CLI smoke tests I added are **correctly implemented** according to the step requirements, but they're failing because the **mcp-coder package needs to be reinstalled** for the test environment to see the updated `main.py` file that contains the `create-pr` command registration (from Step 3).

This is expected behavior and was mentioned in the validation steps of previous steps (Step 4 and Step 5).

**Options:**

**A) Proceed with reinstalling the package now**  
- I need approval to run: `pip install -e .` to reinstall the package in development mode  
- This will make the tests pass  
- Recommended approach for Step 8  

**B) Mark tests with skip condition until package reinstall**  
- Add `@pytest.mark.skipif` to skip tests if create-pr is not in parser  
- Document that package reinstall is required  
- Tests would be runnable after reinstall  

**C) Trust the implementation and skip test verification for now**  
- The code is correct per the spec  
- Package reinstall will be done at PR time anyway  
- Move forward with code quality checks on the test file itself  

Which option do you prefer?
