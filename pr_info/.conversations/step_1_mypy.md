# Mypy Fix Attempt 1

## Mypy Errors:
{"file": "workflows\\create_PR.py", "line": 337, "column": 12, "message": "Statement is unreachable", "hint": null, "code": "unreachable", "severity": "error"}


## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Fix the mypy type errors shown in the output below.

Focus only on resolving the type errors - do not make unnecessary changes to the code.

For each error:
1. Understand the type mismatch or missing annotation
2. Add appropriate type hints or fix incorrect types
3. Use proper typing imports (List, Dict, Optional, etc.) from typing module
4. Ensure all function parameters and return types are properly annotated

Keep changes minimal and focused on type correctness.

Mypy output:
{"file": "workflows\\create_PR.py", "line": 337, "column": 12, "message": "Statement is unreachable", "hint": null, "code": "unreachable", "severity": "error"}


Expected output: Code changes that resolve all type errors while maintaining functionality.

## LLM Fix Response:
I'll fix the mypy type error by examining the code and resolving the unreachable statement issue.Looking at the code, I can see the issue. At line 337, there's a `sys.exit(0)` at the end of the `main()` function, but mypy is detecting this as unreachable code because the function is annotated to return `None`. Since `sys.exit()` never returns (it raises `SystemExit`), the statement is technically unreachable.

However, looking more closely at the code structure, I can see that all the paths in the `main()` function either call `sys.exit(1)` for errors or reach the final `sys.exit(0)` for success. The issue is likely that mypy doesn't recognize that `sys.exit()` calls don't return.

Let me fix this by adding a `return` statement before the final `sys.exit(0)` or by using `NoReturn` type annotation:Now let me run mypy to verify the fix:Perfect! I've successfully fixed the mypy type error by:

1. **Added `NoReturn` import**: Added `NoReturn` to the typing imports from the `typing` module
2. **Changed function return type**: Changed `main() -> None:` to `main() -> NoReturn:` since the function always calls `sys.exit()` and never actually returns normally

The fix resolves the "unreachable statement" error because `NoReturn` properly indicates to mypy that the function never returns normally, making the `sys.exit(0)` call at line 337 the expected behavior rather than unreachable code.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
