# Mypy Fix Attempt 1

## Mypy Errors:
{"file": "workflows\\define_labels.py", "line": 43, "column": 8, "message": "Statement is unreachable", "hint": null, "code": "unreachable", "severity": "error"}


## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Fix the mypy type errors shown in the output below.

Focus only on resolving the type errors - do not make unnecessary changes to the code.

For each error:
1. Understand the type mismatch or missing annotation
2. Add appropriate type hints or fix incorrect types
3. Use proper typing imports (List, Dict, Optional, etc.) from typing module
4. Ensure all function parameters and return types are properly annotated

Keep changes minimal and focused on type correctness.

Mypy output:
{"file": "workflows\\define_labels.py", "line": 43, "column": 8, "message": "Statement is unreachable", "hint": null, "code": "unreachable", "severity": "error"}


Expected output: Code changes that resolve all type errors while maintaining functionality.

## LLM Fix Response:
Perfect! The mypy type error has been resolved.

**Summary:**
- Fixed unreachable code error in `workflows\define_labels.py:43`
- Changed `_validate_color_format()` to use a single return statement instead of multiple returns that created unreachable code
- All pylint checks pass ✅
- All 18 pytest tests pass ✅
- The specific file now has no mypy errors ✅

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed.
