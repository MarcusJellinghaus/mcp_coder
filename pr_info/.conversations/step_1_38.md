# Implementation Task: Fix 3: Remove check=False from test_git_encoding_stress.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Fix 3: Remove check=False from test_git_encoding_stress.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been successfully marked as complete. The checkbox for "Fix 3: Remove check=False from test_git_encoding_stress.py" is now checked `[x]`.

## Summary

**Task Completed Successfully:** Fix 3 - Remove check=False from test_git_encoding_stress.py

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Removed the `check=False` parameter from the `subprocess.run()` call in `tests/utils/test_git_encoding_stress.py` at line 319
2. ✅ Verified all code quality checks pass:
   - Pytest: 1022 tests passed
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Mypy: No type errors
3. ✅ Marked the task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**Prepared commit message:**
```
refactor(step5): remove check=False from test_git_encoding_stress.py

Remove unrelated check=False parameter from subprocess.run() call
in test_subprocess_encoding_directly test, reverting to default behavior.
This parameter was added as part of unrelated changes during issue #151
and should be in its own PR if it addresses a real issue.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)
- ✅ Used MCP code checker tools exclusively (`mcp__code-checker__run_pytest_check`, `mcp__code-checker__run_pylint_check`, `mcp__code-checker__run_mypy_check`)
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The next task to be worked on is: **Fix 4: Standardize test mocking to monkeypatch in test_env.py**
