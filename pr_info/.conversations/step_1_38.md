# Implementation Task: Implement Jenkins credentials retrieval

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement Jenkins credentials retrieval

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Summary: Jenkins Credentials Retrieval Implementation

### ✅ Task Completed

The Jenkins credentials retrieval functionality was **already fully implemented** in `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py`.

### Implementation Details

**Function:** `get_jenkins_credentials()` (lines 330-370)
- **Location:** `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py:330-370`
- **Purpose:** Retrieves Jenkins server URL, username, and API token from environment variables or config file
- **Priority:** Environment variables take precedence over config file values

**Integration:** The function is properly integrated into `execute_coordinator_run()` at line 525:
```python
# Step 3: Get Jenkins credentials (shared across all repos)
server_url, username, api_token = get_jenkins_credentials()
jenkins_client = JenkinsClient(server_url, username, api_token)
```

**Error Handling:** The function validates that all required credentials are present and raises `ValueError` with a helpful message if any are missing.

**Test Coverage:** Comprehensive tests exist in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py`:
- `test_get_jenkins_credentials_from_env` (line 175)
- `test_get_jenkins_credentials_from_config` (line 196)
- `test_get_jenkins_credentials_missing_server_url` (line 224)
- `test_get_jenkins_credentials_missing_username` (line 249)
- `test_get_jenkins_credentials_missing_api_token` (line 274)

### ✅ Code Quality Verification

All code quality checks passed:
- ✅ **Pylint:** No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest:** All 1106 unit tests passed
- ✅ **Mypy:** No type errors found

### ✅ Task Tracker Updated

The task "Implement Jenkins credentials retrieval" has been marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`.

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed: Used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
