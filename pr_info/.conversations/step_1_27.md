# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Looking at the task tracker, I can see that **all implementation steps (1-8) are complete**, but several tasks are missing their git commit message preparation:
- Step 4: Prepare git commit message 
- Step 5: Prepare git commit message
- Step 6: Prepare git commit message
- Step 8: Prepare git commit message

However, you mentioned the current task is "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" - this doesn't match any task in the tracker. 

**Could you clarify which task you'd like me to work on?**

Options:
1. **Complete Step 4 commit message** (interface layer environment variables)
2. **Complete Step 5 commit message** (workflows environment preparation)
3. **Complete Step 6 commit message** (CLI commands updates)
4. **Complete Step 8 commit message** (integration testing)
5. **Start Final Review and PR submission**
6. **Something else related to "core.py"?**

Also note: The MCP filesystem tools are not currently available (`mcp__filesystem__read_file` returned an error), so I'm using standard Read/Write/Edit tools. This may indicate the MCP server needs to be restarted or reconfigured.
