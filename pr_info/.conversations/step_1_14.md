Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The working tree is clean. Based on the TASK_TRACKER.md, all implementation tasks (Steps 1-8) are marked as complete. The only remaining items are:

1. Prepare commit messages for Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8 (marked as `[ ]`)
2. Final PR review and submission

**Could you please clarify which specific task you want me to work on?**

The task you mentioned ("Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions") doesn't appear in the TASK_TRACKER.md. The options I see are:

1. **Prepare commit message for Step 4** (Interface Layer updates)
2. **Prepare commit message for Step 5** (Workflows updates)
3. **Prepare commit message for Step 6** (CLI Commands updates)
4. **Prepare commit message for Step 8** (Integration Testing)
5. **Final PR Review and Submission**

Or is there a different task tracker or planning document I should be looking at?
