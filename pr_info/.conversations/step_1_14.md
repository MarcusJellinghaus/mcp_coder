# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The package name is `mcp-coder` but the import is `mcp_coder`. Let me understand the issue better. The problem is that when you add a new module to a Python package that's installed in editable mode, Python doesn't automatically detect it - you need to reinstall the package. 

Based on the previous conversation logs and the project structure, I understand the situation:

1. **The code files exist and are properly implemented**
2. **The package needs to be reinstalled** so Python recognizes the new `jenkins_operations` module

Let me update the user about this situation:

## Status Update

I've verified that all the required files for Step 1 already exist and are properly implemented:

✅ **Files Present:**
- `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` - Complete with 9 test methods
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py` - Complete with JobStatus and QueueSummary dataclasses
- `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/__init__.py` - Exists with docstring
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/__init__.py` - Exists with docstring

❌ **Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations'`

## Root Cause

The new `jenkins_operations` submodule exists in the source code but Python cannot import it because:
- The package is installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
- When you add a new submodule to an editable-installed package, Python doesn't automatically detect it
- The package needs to be reinstalled for Python to recognize the new module structure

## Solution Required

The `tools/reinstall.bat` script needs to be run to reinstall the package. This script will:
1. Uninstall existing packages  
2. Reinstall `mcp-coder` in development mode  
3. Install development dependencies  
4. Make the new `jenkins_operations` module importable

**I need you to either:**
1. Run `tools\reinstall.bat` manually in your terminal, OR
2. Approve the Bash command so I can run it for you

Once the package is reinstalled, I can proceed with running the full test suite and quality checks to complete Step 1.

Would you like me to proceed with running the reinstall script (requires approval), or would you prefer to run it manually?
