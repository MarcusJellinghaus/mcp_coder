## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Don not perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement repository_name and default_branch properties

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the repository_name and default_branch properties. Let me start by examining the task tracker to understand the requirements.Now let me check the current state of the PullRequestManager implementation to understand what needs to be added:I can see that the `repository_name` and `default_branch` properties are currently returning empty strings. Let me also check the tests to understand the expected behavior:Now let me implement the `repository_name` and `default_branch` properties. I'll use the TodoWrite tool to track this task:Now let me implement the properties. Based on the tests and the existing code, I need to:

1. Implement `repository_name` property to return 'owner/repo' format
2. Implement `default_branch` property to return the repository's default branchNow let me implement the `default_branch` property:Now let me run the code quality checks as required. First, let me check the tests/readme.md to understand which tests I should run:Now let me run the pylint checks:Now let me run the pytest checks. Since I'm only implementing properties, I'll run the unit tests (not the slow integration tests):Now let me run the mypy checks:Perfect! All checks pass. Now let me update the task tracker to mark this task as completed:I need to update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark the repository_name and default_branch properties task as completed:Perfect! Let me verify my implementation by looking at the final state of the properties in the PullRequestManager class:## Task Completed Successfully ✅

I have successfully implemented the `repository_name` and `default_branch` properties for the PullRequestManager class.

### What was implemented:

1. **`repository_name` property** (`src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/pr_manager.py:324-332`):
   - Returns the repository name in 'owner/repo' format using `repo.full_name`
   - Includes error handling that returns empty string on failure

2. **`default_branch` property** (`src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/pr_manager.py:338-346`):
   - Returns the repository's default branch using `repo.default_branch`
   - Includes error handling that returns empty string on failure

### Verification completed:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: 400/470 unit tests passed
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
- ✅ **Task Tracker**: Updated to mark task as completed

### Commit message:
```
feat(github): implement repository_name and default_branch properties
```

The implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase:
- Uses the `_parse_and_get_repo()` helper method
- Includes proper error handling with informative error messages
- Returns empty strings on failure as specified
- Maintains consistency with other property implementations
