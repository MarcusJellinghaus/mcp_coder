# Implementation Task: Update `tests/workflows/create_plan/test_prerequisites.py` with new import paths

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update `tests/workflows/create_plan/test_prerequisites.py` with new import paths

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been successfully marked as complete with `[x]`.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Update `tests/workflows/create_plan/test_prerequisites.py` with new import paths**

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Updated the main import from `from workflows.create_plan import check_prerequisites` to `from mcp_coder.workflows.create_plan import check_prerequisites`
2. ✅ Updated all patch paths (11 occurrences) from `workflows.create_plan.*` to `mcp_coder.workflows.create_plan.*`

### Verification:
- ✅ All 37 tests in the `tests/workflows/create_plan/` directory pass
- ✅ Mypy type checking passes with no errors
- ✅ The changes follow the simple find/replace pattern specified in step_5.md
- ✅ Task marked as complete `[x]` in TASK_TRACKER.md

### Prepared Commit Message:
```
test(workflows): update test_prerequisites.py imports (step 5)

Update test_prerequisites.py to use new import path from 
mcp_coder.workflows.create_plan instead of workflows.create_plan.

Changes:
- Update import statement
- Update all patch paths in test methods
- All tests pass (37 tests in create_plan directory)
```

### All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
✅ Ran code quality checks using MCP tools
✅ All quality checks pass (pytest: 37/37, mypy: no errors)
