# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Issue Found: Package Installation Out of Sync

The pytest failures are caused by an **installation mismatch**:

- **Development code**: `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\targets\mcp_coder\` (current directory with latest changes)
- **Installed package**: `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod\` (production installation running old code)

When pytest runs, it imports from the **installed** package (`mcp_coder_prod`), not from our development directory. The new `coordinator` module and `create_default_config` function exist in our code but aren't in the installed package yet.

**Solution Required**:
According to the AutoRunner project structure, you need to run the `reinstall_coder.bat` script to sync the production installation with our development changes:

```
C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\setup\reinstall_coder.bat
```

This should install the package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`) or copy the latest code to `mcp_coder_prod`.

**Would you like me to**:
1. Wait for you to run the reinstall script and then re-run the tests?
2. Or provide you with an alternative approach to test the code directly?

Please run the reinstall script and let me know when it's complete, then I'll re-run all the code quality checks.
