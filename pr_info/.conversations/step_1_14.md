# Implementation Task: Add logging to show which environment source was used

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add logging to show which environment source was used

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been marked as complete. Let me create a summary of what was verified:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Add logging to show which environment source was used

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Already Implemented)

**Implementation Details:**
- The logging statement was already present in `src/mcp_coder/llm/env.py` at line 67
- The implementation matches exactly what was specified in the step file:
  ```python
  logger.debug("Detected runner environment from %s: %s", source, runner_venv)
  ```
- This log statement shows which source (VIRTUAL_ENV, CONDA_PREFIX, or sys.prefix) was used to detect the runner environment

**Verification:**
- Code review confirmed the logging is correctly implemented
- The logging statement uses the `source` variable returned by `_get_runner_environment()` helper function
- The log level is `debug`, which is appropriate for this type of diagnostic information

**Task Tracker Updated:**
- Changed checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for "Add logging to show which environment source was used"

The task is complete and ready for the next step in the workflow.
