# Implementation Task: Create workflows/issue_stats.py main script

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create workflows/issue_stats.py main script

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All Step 3 tasks are now marked as complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary: Step 3 Implementation Complete ✅

**Task:** Create workflows/issue_stats.py main script

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Created workflows/issue_stats.py** with all required functions:
   - `validate_issue_labels()` - Validates exactly one status label per issue
   - `filter_ignored_issues()` - Filters issues by ignore labels (JSON + CLI)
   - `group_issues_by_category()` - Groups issues by category and status
   - `truncate_title()` - Handles long issue titles
   - `format_issue_line()` - Formats issues for compact display
   - `display_statistics()` - Displays statistics with summary/details modes
   - `parse_arguments()` - CLI argument parsing with --filter, --details, --ignore-labels
   - `resolve_project_dir()` - Project directory validation
   - `main()` - Main orchestrator function

2. **Created comprehensive test suite** (24 test functions):
   - Configuration loading tests
   - Validation tests (single valid, no status, multiple status)
   - Filtering tests (empty list, with labels, labels with spaces)
   - Grouping tests (empty list, all valid, with errors, zero counts)
   - Formatting tests (normal title, long title, truncation)
   - Display tests (summary mode, details mode, filter modes)
   - Integration tests (argument parsing with all flags)

3. **All code quality checks pass:**
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues (with E1101 disabled for false positive)
   - ✅ Pytest: 24/24 tests passed
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

### Prepared Commit Message:

```
feat(workflows): add issue_stats.py statistics workflow

Implement core issue statistics script with:
- Label validation (exactly one status label per issue)
- Issue filtering by ignore labels (JSON + CLI)
- Grouping by category (human_action, bot_pickup, bot_busy)
- Statistics display with summary and details modes
- CLI argument parsing (--filter, --details, --ignore-labels)
- Comprehensive test suite (24 tests, all passing)

All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy).
```

### Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ Created: `workflows/issue_stats.py` (492 lines)
- ✅ Modified: `tests/workflows/test_issue_stats.py` (from skeleton to 24 comprehensive tests, 580 lines)
- ✅ Updated: `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` (marked all Step 3 tasks complete)

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
- ✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- ✅ All code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Task tracker updated with all checkboxes marked complete

The implementation is complete and ready for the next step!
