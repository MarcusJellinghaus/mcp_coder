# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_get_eligible_issues_empty_result()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_get_eligible_issues_empty_result()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Summary

I have successfully completed the task to write the test `test_get_eligible_issues_empty_result()`. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ STEP 1: SELECT TASK
- Identified the task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test `test_get_eligible_issues_empty_result()`

### ✅ STEP 2: IMPLEMENT
- Added the test method to `TestGetEligibleIssues` class in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:1062-1103`
- The test verifies that `get_eligible_issues()` returns an empty list without error when no eligible issues are found
- Follows the same pattern as the other three tests in the class
- Properly mocks `load_labels_config` and `IssueManager` 
- Verifies the function returns an empty list when `IssueManager.list_issues()` returns no issues

### ✅ STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS
- **Pylint**: ✅ Passed - No style issues found
- **Pytest**: ⚠️ Expected failures - Tests fail because `get_eligible_issues()` function hasn't been implemented yet (TDD approach)
- **Mypy**: ⚠️ Expected failures - Type checker reports missing function (will be resolved when implementation is complete)

### ✅ STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION
- Re-read task requirements - confirmed all requirements met
- Test correctly handles empty result case as specified in step_2.md

### ✅ STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE
```
test: add test_get_eligible_issues_empty_result

Add test case for empty result handling in get_eligible_issues function. 
Verifies function returns empty list without error when no eligible issues found.

Part of Step 2 (Issue Filtering Logic) - TDD approach.
```

### ✅ STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE
- Updated `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to mark the task as `[x]` complete

### Important Notes:
- This is a **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** workflow where tests are written before implementation
- The pytest and mypy failures are **expected** since the `get_eligible_issues()` function hasn't been implemented yet
- The implementation will come in subsequent tasks in Step 2
- Once the implementation is complete, all four tests in `TestGetEligibleIssues` will pass

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for file operations and code quality checks.
