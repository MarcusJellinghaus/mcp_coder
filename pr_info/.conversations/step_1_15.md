# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need to understand the issue better. The error shows that the tests cannot import the module. This usually means the package needs to be reinstalled after adding new modules. However, I cannot run pip install without approval. Let me inform the user about this issue and ask for permission:

Looking at the test failures, I can see that the **jenkins_operations module cannot be imported** even though all the files exist. This is a common issue when new modules are added to a Python package - the package needs to be reinstalled in editable mode.

**The Issue:**  
- All files have been created correctly (models.py, __init__.py files, test files)
- However, Python cannot find the new `mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations` module
- Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_coder.utils.jenkins_operations'`

**Why This Happens:**  
When you add new packages/modules to a Python project, especially when working with editable installs (`pip install -e .`), sometimes the package needs to be reinstalled for Python to recognize the new module structure.

**Solution Needed:**  
I need to run: `pip install -e .` to reinstall the package in editable mode.

However, this command requires your approval. Would you like me to proceed with reinstalling the package? This is safe and is a standard step when adding new modules to a Python package.

Alternatively, if you have a specific command or batch file that handles reinstallation in your project, please let me know and I can use that instead.
