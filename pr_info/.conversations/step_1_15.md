# Implementation Task: Update `prepare_llm_environment()` to use new helper function

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update `prepare_llm_environment()` to use new helper function

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Complete ✅

I have successfully completed the task: **Update `prepare_llm_environment()` to use new helper function**

### Summary

The `prepare_llm_environment()` function in `src/mcp_coder/llm/env.py:45` was already correctly updated to use the `_get_runner_environment()` helper function. The implementation includes:

1. ✅ **Helper function call**: Calls `_get_runner_environment()` to get validated runner environment and source
2. ✅ **Source logging**: Uses the returned source name for debug logging
3. ✅ **Path conversion**: Converts paths to absolute OS-native strings
4. ✅ **Environment variables**: Returns MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR and MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR

### Verification Results

All code quality checks passed:
- ✅ **Pytest**: 1022 tests passed (fast unit tests, excluding integration tests)
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Files Modified

- `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`: Marked task as complete (`[x]`)

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**: Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations (mcp__filesystem__*, mcp__code-checker__*).
