## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE: MCP Server Tools Not Accessible**

The MCP filesystem tools specified in CLAUDE.md are not available:
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - not found
- `mcp__filesystem__read_reference_file` - not found

According to CLAUDE.md instructions, I must **IMMEDIATELY ALERT** when MCP tools are not accessible, as this blocks all work until resolved.

**This needs to be fixed before I can proceed with the task.** The MCP server may need to be:
1. Started/restarted
2. Properly configured
3. Connected to this session

Would you like me to use the standard Read tool as a fallback to proceed with the task, or should we resolve the MCP server connection first?
