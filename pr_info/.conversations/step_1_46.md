# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_coordinator_run_all_and_repo_mutually_exclusive()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_coordinator_run_all_and_repo_mutually_exclusive()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! ✅ The main task has been marked as complete.

## Summary

**Task Completed:** Write test: `test_coordinator_run_all_and_repo_mutually_exclusive()`

**What was implemented:**
- Added a new test method `test_coordinator_run_all_and_repo_mutually_exclusive()` to the `TestCoordinatorRunCommand` class in `tests/cli/test_main.py`
- The test verifies that argparse correctly raises a `SystemExit` error when both `--all` and `--repo` flags are provided together
- This validates the mutually exclusive group behavior in the CLI argument parser

**Code quality verification:**
✅ Pylint: No issues found
✅ Pytest: All 1111 tests passed (including the new test)
✅ Mypy: No type errors found

**Task tracker updated:**
✅ Changed checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations
✅ Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
✅ All code quality checks passed before completion

The implementation is complete and ready for the next task in the workflow!
