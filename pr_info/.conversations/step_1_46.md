# Implementation Task: Test script detects issues without labels

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Test script detects issues without labels

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I understand. Since I need to perform manual integration testing with the GitHub API, let me ask the user for permission to proceed.

Based on my review of the code and tests, I can see that:

1. **The script correctly handles issues without labels** - the `check_status_labels()` function returns `(0, [])` when no workflow labels are found
2. **The script initializes such issues** - the `process_issues()` function detects count==0 and calls `add_labels()` to add the "created" label
3. **There are comprehensive unit tests** - `test_process_issues_single_issue_needs_initialization()` verifies this behavior
4. **The batch file exists** - `test_batch_file_exists()` confirms it

However, to complete the **manual integration testing** requirement from step 5, I need to:
1. Run the actual script against the live GitHub API
2. Verify it detects issues without labels in the real repository
3. Test it in both dry-run and live modes

**To proceed with manual integration testing, I need your approval to:**
- Run `workflows\validate_labels.bat --dry-run` to preview what the script would do
- Run queries against the GitHub API to check current issue states

**Alternative approach:** Since the unit tests already comprehensively cover the "issues without labels" detection logic, I can document that this functionality is verified through:
1. Unit tests that mock the entire workflow
2. The existing code structure that explicitly handles the `count == 0` case
3. Previous integration testing from Step 4 that confirmed the script runs end-to-end

Would you like me to:
- **Option A**: Proceed with live GitHub API integration testing (requires approval for Bash commands)
- **Option B**: Document that the functionality is verified through comprehensive unit tests and mark the task complete
- **Option C**: Create additional unit tests that specifically focus on the "no labels" detection scenario

Which approach would you prefer?
