# Implementation Task: Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_all_invalid_uses_sys_prefix`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_all_invalid_uses_sys_prefix`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been successfully marked as complete.

## Summary

✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

I have successfully implemented the test `test_prepare_llm_environment_all_invalid_uses_sys_prefix` as requested.

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Added test `test_prepare_llm_environment_all_invalid_uses_sys_prefix` to `tests/llm/test_env.py:124`
2. ✅ The test verifies that when both VIRTUAL_ENV and CONDA_PREFIX point to non-existent paths, the function correctly falls back to `sys.prefix`
3. ✅ All code quality checks passed:
   - Pylint: No issues found
   - Pytest: Test passed (1/1)
   - Mypy: No type errors
4. ✅ Task marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**Commit message prepared:**
```
test: add invalid path fallback test

Add test_prepare_llm_environment_all_invalid_uses_sys_prefix to verify that when both
VIRTUAL_ENV and CONDA_PREFIX point to non-existent paths, the function correctly falls
back to sys.prefix as the final fallback option.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively (`mcp__filesystem__read_file`, `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`)
- ✅ Used MCP code checker tools exclusively (`mcp__code-checker__run_*`)
- ✅ All code quality checks passed
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
- ✅ Task marked as complete in tracker

The next unchecked task in the tracker is: "Run pylint - fix all issues found" (Step 2.5).
