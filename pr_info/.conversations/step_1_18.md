# Implementation Task: Configure PYTHONPATH setup in batch script

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Configure PYTHONPATH setup in batch script

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Here's a summary:

## Task Complete: Configure PYTHONPATH setup in batch script

**What was done:**
- Verified that `workflows/issue_stats.bat` already has the correct PYTHONPATH configuration
- The line `set PYTHONPATH=%~dp0..\src;%PYTHONPATH%` was already present and correctly configured
- This matches the exact pattern from `define_labels.bat` as required

**PYTHONPATH Configuration Details:**
- `%~dp0` - Gets the batch file's directory (workflows/)
- `..\src` - Navigates up one level and into the src/ directory
- `;%PYTHONPATH%` - Preserves any existing PYTHONPATH settings

**Code Quality Verification:**
✅ **Pylint**: No issues found  
✅ **Pytest**: 984/988 tests passed (4 skipped)  
✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

**File Location:** workflows/issue_stats.bat:29

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed. The PYTHONPATH setup was already correctly implemented in the batch script, following the same pattern as define_labels.bat.
