## Summary

**Task completed: Step 15 - Update Tests for New Error Handling**

### What was done:

1. **Verified test_claude_code_api_error_handling.py expectations**: All tests already expect `ClaudeAPIError` (not bare `Exception` or `CalledProcessError`) and error messages match the implementation.

2. **Checked for bare Exception handling tests**: No tests for bare `Exception` handling were found in the codebase that needed removal.

3. **Ran full test suite**: All 595 unit tests pass successfully.

4. **Verified specific tests**: The 5 error handling tests mentioned in the task description all pass:
   - `test_windows_path_length_error_handling`
   - `test_cli_not_found_error_with_path_found`
   - `test_cli_not_found_error_without_path_found`
   - `test_file_not_found_error_handling`
   - `test_permission_error_handling`

5. **Ran all quality checks**: 
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues
   - ✅ Pytest: 595 tests passed
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors

### Outcome:

The tests were already correctly aligned with the refactored error handling implementation. No changes to test code were needed - the task was verification only.

### Commit message:

```
test(errors): verify test expectations for refactored error handling

Verified that test_claude_code_api_error_handling.py expectations match
the decorator-based error handling implementation. All tests correctly
expect ClaudeAPIError and proper error messages. No bare Exception tests
found that needed removal. All quality checks pass.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** ✅
