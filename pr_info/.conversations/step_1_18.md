# Implementation Task: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify all tests pass and fix any issues found (see step_5.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The issue is that the package installation in `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\mcp_coder_prod\.venv` is out of date and doesn't include the new code from steps 1-5 that was created in `C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\targets\mcp_coder`.

According to the AutoRunner project structure documentation in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, there's a reinstall script at `local-windows/setup/reinstall_coder.bat` that should update the production environment.

**The user needs to run:**

```bash
C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\setup\reinstall_coder.bat
```

This will reinstall mcp-coder from the targets directory into the production venv, which will make all the new modules (coordinator.py, create_default_config, etc.) available to pytest.

However, I notice that I may be able to try a quick fix by using the bash tool with approval. Let me try:

I need the user to approve running the reinstall. But actually, looking at the CLAUDE.md, the standard approach is to use batch scripts. Let me just inform the user what needs to be done:

**Issue Found:** The pytest failures are due to an outdated package installation. The code in `targets/mcp_coder` is up-to-date (all steps 1-5 completed), but the installed package in `mcp_coder_prod/.venv` doesn't include these new files yet.

**Solution Required:** Please run the reinstall script to update the production environment:

```cmd
C:\Users\Marcus\Documents\GitHub\AutoRunner\local-windows\setup\reinstall_coder.bat
```

This will:
1. Copy the latest code from `targets/mcp_coder` to `mcp_coder_prod`
2. Reinstall the package in editable mode
3. Make all new modules available to pytest

After running the reinstall script, the tests should pass.

Should I wait for you to run this, or would you like me to attempt the reinstallation using the available tools?
