Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: MCP Server Issues**

The MCP filesystem tools are not accessible (`mcp__filesystem__read_file` not found). According to CLAUDE.md, this blocks all work until resolved.

**Issue:** MCP tools required by CLAUDE.md are unavailable:
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` 
- `mcp__filesystem__*` tools

This prevents me from following the mandatory instructions. The MCP server may need to be:
1. Started or restarted
2. Properly configured
3. Connected to the Claude Code environment

**Please resolve the MCP server accessibility issue before I can proceed with the task.**
