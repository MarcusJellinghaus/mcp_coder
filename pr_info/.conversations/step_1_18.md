# Implementation Task: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create test file `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py` with TDD tests

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
The init files exist. Given that:
1. The files are created in the correct location
2. The simple test works (showing pytest can run in that directory)
3. The import test fails with ModuleNotFoundError

This strongly suggests that the Python process running the tests doesn't have the package installed or has a stale cache. Since I can't restart the MCP server process, let me ask the user for help:

I've successfully created the test file and the models source file, but I'm encountering an issue where the MCP code-checker can't import the new module. This appears to be because:

1. The MCP code-checker is using a Python environment from `mcp_coder_prod\.venv` 
2. That environment may not have been updated or may have stale import caches
3. Even though the package is installed in editable mode, the running MCP server process may not recognize the new module directory

**Would you be able to restart Claude Code or the MCP server?** This should allow the Python process to recognize the new `jenkins_operations` module that was just created.

Alternatively, if there's a specific command or workflow to refresh the MCP server's Python environment, please let me know and I can run it.

The files have been created correctly at:
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/__init__.py`
- `src/mcp_coder/utils/jenkins_operations/models.py`
- `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/__init__.py`
- `tests/utils/jenkins_operations/test_models.py`

Once the environment is refreshed, the tests should run successfully.
