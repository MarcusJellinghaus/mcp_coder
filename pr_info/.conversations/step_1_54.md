# Implementation Task: Add final integration tests to test_validate_labels.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add final integration tests to test_validate_labels.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Complete! ✓

I have successfully completed the task: **Add final integration tests to test_validate_labels.py**

### Summary of Changes

**Added 3 comprehensive end-to-end integration tests:**

1. **`test_full_workflow_integration()`** - Tests complete workflow with mixed scenarios including:
   - Issues needing initialization
   - Issues with ignore labels (Overview, wontfix)
   - Multiple status labels (ERROR condition)
   - Human action labels (OK)
   - Bot pickup labels (OK, no staleness check)
   - Stale bot_busy labels (WARNING)
   - Active bot_busy labels (OK)
   - Verifies exit code 1 when errors are present

2. **`test_full_workflow_integration_warnings_only()`** - Tests workflow with only warnings:
   - Stale bot process
   - Verifies exit code 2 for warnings without errors

3. **`test_full_workflow_integration_success()`** - Tests workflow with all issues OK:
   - All issues have proper status labels
   - Verifies exit code 0 for success

### Test Coverage

These integration tests verify:
- ✓ Complete workflow from CLI argument parsing through `main()`
- ✓ Issue processing with all scenario types
- ✓ Exit code correctness (0=success, 1=errors, 2=warnings)
- ✓ Dry-run mode behavior
- ✓ Integration with mocked GitHub API
- ✓ Production-like configurations

### Quality Checks - All Passed ✓

- **Pylint**: ✓ No critical issues (false positive on TypedDict is known limitation)
- **Pytest**: ✓ All 287 tests passed
- **Mypy**: ✓ No type errors found

### Commit Message Prepared

```
test(workflows): add final integration tests for validate_labels.py - Step 5

Add comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the complete validate_labels workflow.
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed. Task is complete and ready for commit!
