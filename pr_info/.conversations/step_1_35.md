# Implementation Task: Verify code examples in documentation are correct

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Verify code examples in documentation are correct

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! The task has been successfully marked as complete. Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

✅ **Task: Verify code examples in documentation are correct**

### What Was Done:

1. **Comprehensive Documentation Review:**
   - **README.md** - Verified all code examples including:
     - User configuration TOML format and API usage (`get_config_value()`, `get_config_file_path()`)
     - LLM interface examples (`ask_llm()`, `ask_claude_code()`)
     - Git operations examples (`is_git_repository()`, `get_full_status()`, `commit_all_changes()`, `commit_staged_files()`, `git_push()`)
   - **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Confirmed no executable code examples present (only documentation)
   - **.mcp.json** - Verified correct usage of environment variables (`${MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR}`, `${MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR}`)
   - **DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md** - Confirmed workflow descriptions only, no code verification needed

2. **Verification Results:**
   - ✅ All code examples in README.md are correct and match the actual implementation
   - ✅ All function signatures match the source code in:
     - `src/mcp_coder/utils/user_config.py`
     - `src/mcp_coder/llm/interface.py`
     - `src/mcp_coder/utils/git_operations/` (multiple files)
   - ✅ Configuration examples are accurate
   - ✅ No fixes were required

3. **Code Quality Checks:**
   - ✅ **Pytest**: 982 tests passed (fast unit tests excluding integration tests)
   - ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
   - ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

4. **Task Tracker Updated:**
   - ✅ Marked "Verify code examples in documentation are correct" as complete
   - ✅ Marked "Run pylint - fix all issues found" as complete
   - ✅ Marked "Run pytest - verify all tests pass" as complete
   - ✅ Marked "Run mypy - fix all issues found" as complete

### Conclusion:
All code examples in documentation are accurate and up-to-date. No corrections were needed. All quality checks pass successfully.

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - Used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
