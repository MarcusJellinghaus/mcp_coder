# Implementation Task: Implement repository list extraction (--all or --repo)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement repository list extraction (--all or --repo)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now let me verify the task completion by re-reading the requirements:

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Implement repository list extraction (--all or --repo)**

### What was implemented:

The repository list extraction logic in `execute_coordinator_run()` function includes:

1. **Single repository mode** (`--repo`):
   - Creates a list with just the specified repository name
   - `repo_names = [args.repo]`

2. **All repositories mode** (`--all`):
   - Reads the TOML config file using `tomllib`
   - Extracts all repository names from `[coordinator.repos.*]` sections
   - Validates that at least one repository is configured
   - Returns error code 1 if no repositories are found

3. **Error handling**:
   - Validates that either `--all` or `--repo` is specified
   - Prints clear error messages for configuration issues
   - Uses proper logging for debugging

### Code location:
`src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py:484-503`

### Verification:
✅ All 6 tests pass (including `test_execute_coordinator_run_requires_all_or_repo`)
✅ Pylint check passed - no issues found
✅ Mypy check passed - no type errors
✅ Implementation follows the specification in `pr_info/steps/step_4.md`

### Task status updated:
✅ Marked task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed** - used MCP filesystem tools exclusively for file operations and MCP code-checker tools for quality verification.
