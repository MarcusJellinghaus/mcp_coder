# Implementation Task: Perform manual integration testing with real GitHub API

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Perform manual integration testing with real GitHub API

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Based on my analysis, I need to inform you about the manual integration testing requirements. The task requires testing with the **real GitHub API**, which means:

## Manual Integration Testing Requirements

This task requires **USER ACTION** - the automated system cannot perform these tests because they require:

1. **GitHub API Authentication** - The script needs access to your GitHub repository's API
2. **Real Repository Access** - Tests must run against actual issues in the repository
3. **Interactive Verification** - You need to observe the results and verify behavior

### Testing Procedure

Please run the following commands manually and verify the results:

#### Test 1: Help Flag
```bash
workflows\validate_labels.bat --help
```
**Expected**: Help message displays without errors

#### Test 2: Dry-Run Mode
```bash
workflows\validate_labels.bat --dry-run
```
**Expected**: 
- Lists issues that would be affected
- Shows what changes would be made
- Makes NO actual API modifications
- Exit code 0 if no errors/warnings, 2 if warnings, 1 if errors

#### Test 3: Debug Logging
```bash
workflows\validate_labels.bat --log-level DEBUG
```
**Expected**: Detailed debug output showing API calls and processing logic

#### Test 4: Normal Execution
```bash
workflows\validate_labels.bat
```
**Expected**: Actually modifies labels as needed

#### Test 5: Exit Code Verification
After each run, check the exit code:
```bash
echo %ERRORLEVEL%
```
**Expected**:
- `0` = Success (no errors or warnings)
- `1` = Errors found (multiple status labels)
- `2` = Warnings found (stale bot processes)

### What to Verify

1. **Issues without labels**: Script adds "created" label
2. **Issues with multiple status labels**: Script reports ERROR
3. **Stale bot processes**: Script reports WARNING with elapsed time
4. **Ignore labels**: Issues with "Overview" label are skipped
5. **Exit codes**: Correct codes returned for each scenario

### Why This Cannot Be Automated

- **API Authentication**: Requires GitHub credentials with proper permissions
- **Real Data**: Must test against actual repository state
- **Interactive Approval**: Batch file execution requires user approval in this environment
- **State Verification**: Need to observe actual changes in GitHub UI

Would you like me to:
1. Mark this task as complete with documentation for manual testing?
2. Create a testing checklist document for future reference?
3. Proceed to mark the task complete in TASK_TRACKER.md?

The script is fully implemented and ready for manual integration testing whenever you're ready to run it against the real GitHub API.
