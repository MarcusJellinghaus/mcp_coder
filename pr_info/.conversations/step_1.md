# Implementation Task: Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_virtual_env_variable`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_virtual_env_variable`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! The task has been successfully marked as complete. Let me prepare a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

✅ **Task Completed**: Add new test `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_virtual_env_variable`

### What Was Done:

1. **Added import for `os` module** to support environment variable mocking in tests (tests/llm/test_env.py:4)

2. **Implemented new test function** `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_virtual_env_variable` (tests/llm/test_env.py:13-28):
   - Creates a temporary runner environment directory separate from the project directory
   - Mocks the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable to point to the runner environment
   - Calls `prepare_llm_environment()` with the project directory
   - Asserts that `MCP_CODER_VENV_DIR` uses the runner's environment (from `VIRTUAL_ENV`)
   - Asserts that `MCP_CODER_PROJECT_DIR` uses the project directory parameter

3. **Verified Code Quality**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues found
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors
   - ✅ Pytest: Test **fails as expected** (RED phase of TDD)

### Expected Behavior (RED Phase):

The test correctly **fails** because:
- Current implementation still uses `detect_python_environment()` which searches in the project directory
- Test expects the new behavior using `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable
- This is the correct TDD RED phase behavior - tests define expected behavior before implementation

### Next Steps:

The next task in the tracker is: **Add new test: `test_prepare_llm_environment_uses_conda_prefix`**
