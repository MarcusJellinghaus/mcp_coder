# Implementation Task: Create `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_plan.py` with `execute_create_plan()` function (step_1.md)

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_plan.py` with `execute_create_plan()` function (step_1.md)

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! All Step 1 tasks are now marked as complete with `[x]`. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Step 1 Complete: Create CLI Command Handler Structure

**Task Summary:**  
Successfully created `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_plan.py` with the `execute_create_plan()` function following the established pattern from `implement.py`.

**What was implemented:**
1. ✅ Created new CLI command handler file at `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_plan.py`
2. ✅ Implemented `execute_create_plan(args)` function with proper:
   - Type hints (`argparse.Namespace` → `int`)
   - Docstring with Args and Returns sections
   - Project directory resolution using `resolve_project_dir()`
   - LLM method parsing using `parse_llm_method_from_args()`
   - Lazy import of workflow module (to avoid circular dependencies)
   - Proper exception handling (KeyboardInterrupt, general exceptions)
   - Logging and error messages

**Code Quality Checks:**
- ✅ **Pylint**: Only expected import error (workflow module doesn't exist yet - will be created in Step 2)
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 1088 tests pass, 4 skipped
- ✅ **Mypy**: Only expected type issues related to missing workflow module

**Known Expected Issues:**
- Import error for `mcp_coder.workflows.create_plan` - **This is expected and will be resolved in Step 2**

**Prepared Commit Message:**
```
Create CLI command handler for create-plan workflow

Created src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/create_plan.py with execute_create_plan() 
function following the established pattern from implement.py. Handler parses 
command-line arguments and delegates to workflow module (to be created in Step 2).

Note: Expected import errors for workflows.create_plan module will be resolved 
when the workflow module is created in subsequent steps.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**  
✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively  
✅ Ran all required code quality checks (pylint, pytest, mypy)  
✅ All tasks in TASK_TRACKER.md marked as complete  

**Next Step:** Step 2a - Copy workflow file to new location
