# Implementation Task: Implement `workflows/create_plan.bat` - Batch wrapper with UTF-8 encoding

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement `workflows/create_plan.bat` - Batch wrapper with UTF-8 encoding

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Let me provide a summary of what was completed:

## ✅ Task Complete: Implement `workflows/create_plan.bat`

### Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented the first task from Step 1 of the create_plan workflow:

**Files Created:**
1. ✅ **workflows/create_plan.bat** - Windows batch wrapper with UTF-8 encoding
   - Sets console codepage to UTF-8 (65001)
   - Configures Python environment variables for UTF-8 encoding
   - Sets PYTHONPATH to include src directory
   - Passes all arguments to Python script using `%*`

2. ✅ **workflows/create_plan.py** - Main workflow script with argument parsing
   - `parse_arguments()` - Parses CLI arguments (issue_number, project_dir, log_level, llm_method)
   - `resolve_project_dir()` - Validates and resolves project directory with comprehensive checks
   - `main()` - Workflow orchestration skeleton (ready for future steps)

3. ✅ **tests/workflows/create_plan/test_argument_parsing.py** - Comprehensive test suite
   - 23 test cases covering all argument parsing scenarios
   - Tests for both `parse_arguments()` and `resolve_project_dir()` functions
   - Edge cases, error handling, and validation

### Code Quality Checks - All Passing ✅

- ✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 23 tests passed (8.15 seconds)
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

### Commit Message Prepared

```
feat(create-plan): implement batch wrapper with UTF-8 encoding - Step 1

Create Windows batch wrapper and Python script with argument parsing for
the create_plan workflow. Includes issue number parsing, project directory
validation, and comprehensive test coverage.
```

### Task Tracker Updated

✅ Marked task as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for code quality checks
- ✅ All three code quality checks passed
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved
- ✅ Task marked as `[x]` in TASK_TRACKER.md
