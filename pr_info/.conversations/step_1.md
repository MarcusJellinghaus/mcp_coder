## Task Complete ✅

**Working on:** Step 1 - Implement TypedDict classes (IssueData, CommentData, LabelData) in issue_manager.py

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_manager.py`
- Implemented three TypedDict classes following the exact pattern from `pr_manager.py`:
  - `IssueData`: Contains issue fields (number, title, body, state, labels, user, timestamps, url, locked)
  - `CommentData`: Contains comment fields (id, body, user, timestamps, url)
  - `LabelData`: Contains label fields (name, color, description)
- Added comprehensive docstrings for each TypedDict
- Used `Optional` for nullable fields as per GitHub API specifications

**Quality Checks:** ✅ All passed
- Pylint: No issues
- Mypy: No type errors
- Pytest: 532 tests passed

**Commit Message:**
```
Implement TypedDict classes for GitHub issue data structures

Add IssueData, CommentData, and LabelData TypedDict classes to issue_manager.py
following the same patterns as PullRequestData in pr_manager.py.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed**
