# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Based on my analysis of the TASK_TRACKER.md, I can see that **all 8 implementation steps are already complete**. The current state shows:
- Steps 1-8: Implementation is done âœ…
- Steps 4, 5, 6, 8: Still need commit messages prepared

The user mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" but this doesn't match the actual task tracker. The tracker shows that Step 5 involves updating `src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py` which is already marked as complete.

**I believe there may be a miscommunication. According to TASK_TRACKER.md, the next uncompleted task is:**

**Step 4: Prepare git commit message for Step 4**

However, before proceeding, I should clarify with the user what they actually want me to do. Let me ask:

---

I've reviewed the TASK_TRACKER.md and I see that all 8 implementation steps are already marked as complete (code + checks pass). The only remaining tasks are:

- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 4
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 5  
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 6
- [ ] Prepare git commit message for Step 8

Your message mentions "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" but I don't see this as a task in the tracker. The `core.py` file (`src/mcp_coder/workflows/implement/core.py`) was already updated in Step 5 which is marked complete.

**Could you clarify which task you'd like me to work on?**

Options:
1. Prepare the commit message for Step 4 (the next uncompleted checkbox)
2. A different implementation task not shown in TASK_TRACKER.md
3. Something else?
