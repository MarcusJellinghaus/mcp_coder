# Implementation Task: Write tests in tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write tests in tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the TASK_TRACKER.md to understand the current task and then implement it.I can see the current task is: **Write tests in tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py** (Step 1, first task)

Let me first check the existing code structure and then write the tests.Now let me check the existing test file to understand the current test structure:Let me read the file in parts:Let me use the Read tool instead with pagination:Let me continue reading to see what tests are already there:Let me create a TodoWrite to track the task:Now let me check if there are already any tests for get_branch_diff():It looks like there are already tests for `get_branch_diff`. Let me check what the existing test class looks like:Perfect! I can see that the tests for `get_branch_diff()` function already exist and are quite comprehensive. Let me check if there's any additional test coverage needed by looking at the function implementation again:The existing tests for `get_branch_diff()` seem comprehensive and cover:
1. Valid diff between branches
2. Auto-detection of base branch
3. Path exclusion
4. Invalid repository
5. Missing base branch
6. No changes between branches
7. When current branch is the base branch

These tests adequately cover all the major scenarios and edge cases for the `get_branch_diff()` function. The tests are already written and look complete. Let me verify this by running the tests to make sure they pass:Great! All tests for `get_branch_diff()` are passing. Now let me update my todo to reflect that this task is complete:Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark this task as complete:Perfect! The task "Write tests in tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py" has been completed successfully. The tests for the `get_branch_diff()` function already exist in the test file and all 7 tests are passing. 

The tests cover comprehensive scenarios including:
- Valid diff generation between branches
- Auto-detection of base branch
- Path exclusion functionality
- Error handling for invalid repositories
- Handling missing base branches
- Empty diff when no changes exist
- Handling when current branch is the base branch

Task completed: Step 1 - Write tests in tests/utils/test_git_workflows.py âœ…
