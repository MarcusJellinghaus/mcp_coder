# Implementation Task: Implement unit tests for LabelsManager class validation and initialization

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement unit tests for LabelsManager class validation and initialization

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I've successfully completed **Step 1: Unit Tests for LabelsManager Validation**

### What was implemented:

1. **Created test class `TestLabelsManagerUnit`** in `tests/utils/test_github_operations.py` with 5 test methods:
   - `test_initialization_requires_project_dir` - validates None project_dir raises ValueError
   - `test_initialization_requires_git_repository` - validates non-git directory raises ValueError  
   - `test_initialization_requires_github_token` - validates missing token raises ValueError
   - `test_label_name_validation` - tests valid/invalid label names (empty, whitespace, leading/trailing spaces)
   - `test_color_validation_and_normalization` - tests hex color validation and '#' prefix normalization

2. **Created stub implementation** in `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/labels_manager.py`:
   - `LabelData` TypedDict for type safety
   - `LabelsManager` class stub with NotImplementedError (TDD approach)
   - Validation method stubs: `_validate_label_name`, `_validate_color`, `_normalize_color`

3. **Updated exports** in `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/__init__.py`

4. **Quality checks passed**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No errors
   - ✅ Mypy: No type errors
   - ✅ Pytest: All 5 tests fail as expected (TDD red phase - NotImplementedError)

### Commit message:

```
Add unit tests for LabelsManager validation (Step 1)

- Create TestLabelsManagerUnit with 5 validation tests
- Add stub LabelsManager and LabelData in labels_manager.py
- Update __init__.py exports for LabelsManager
- Tests fail with NotImplementedError (TDD red phase)
- All quality checks pass (pylint, mypy)
```

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
