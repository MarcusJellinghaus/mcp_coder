# Implementation Task: Add `assignees: List[str]` field to IssueData TypedDict

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add `assignees: List[str]` field to IssueData TypedDict

## üìã TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Task:** Add `assignees: List[str]` field to IssueData TypedDict

### ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished:

   - Placed before `user` field as specified in requirements

2. **Updated All IssueData Construction Sites**
   - Updated 20 IssueData return statements throughout the file
   - Error returns: Added `assignees=[]` for empty/error cases
   - Success returns: Added `assignees=[assignee.login for assignee in github_issue.assignees]` to extract assignee usernames from GitHub API

3. **Code Quality Verification**
   - ‚úÖ Pylint: No issues found
   - ‚úÖ Pytest: All 49 issue_manager tests pass
   - ‚úÖ Mypy: No type errors found

### üìù Prepared Commit Message:
```
Add assignees field to IssueData TypedDict

- Added assignees: List[str] field to IssueData TypedDict
- Updated all IssueData construction sites to include assignees field
- Populated assignees from GitHub API issue.assignees attribute
- All code quality checks pass (pylint, pytest, mypy)
```

### ‚úÖ Task Tracker Updated:
All Step 1 tasks marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

---

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ‚úÖ Used MCP code-checker tools exclusively (no Bash for checks)
- ‚úÖ Used MCP filesystem tools for file operations
- ‚úÖ All code quality checks passed
- ‚úÖ Compliance verified

The task is now **COMPLETE** and ready for the next step in the workflow!
