# Implementation Task: Add `from enum import Enum` to imports in issue_manager.py

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add `from enum import Enum` to imports in issue_manager.py

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully.

## Summary

✅ **Task completed**: Add `from enum import Enum` to imports in issue_manager.py

**What was done:**
- Added `from enum import Enum` import at line 8 in `src/mcp_coder/utils/github_operations/issue_manager.py`
- Import placed correctly in alphabetical order after standard library imports
- All code quality checks passed (pylint, mypy)
- Task marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

**Commit message prepared:**
```
Add Enum import to issue_manager.py for IssueEventType enum

Import added in preparation for implementing event timeline retrieval
capability in IssueManager class. This will support stale bot process
detection by tracking label events.
```

**All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:**
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools exclusively
- ✅ Ran all required code quality checks (pylint, mypy, pytest)
- ✅ All checks passed
- ✅ Task marked complete in tracker

The next task in the workflow is to add the IssueEventType enum after imports, before TypedDicts (around line 50).
