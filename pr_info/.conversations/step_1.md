# Implementation Task: Create `src/mcp_coder/cli/utils.py` with `parse_llm_method_from_args()` function

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Create `src/mcp_coder/cli/utils.py` with `parse_llm_method_from_args()` function

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll look at the task tracker and implement the requested task. Let me start by reading the task details.Now let me look at the test readme to understand what tests I should run:Let me check the current CLI structure to understand what I need to implement:Let me look at the step 1 detail to understand what I need to implement:I'll implement Step 1 by creating the CLI utility module with the `parse_llm_method_from_args()` function. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this task.Now let me examine the existing LLM session module to understand what I need to import:Let me check the resolver module to understand the existing function:Perfect! Now I understand the existing function. Let me start implementing by creating the CLI utility module:Now let me create comprehensive tests for this utility function:Now let me run the pylint check to ensure code quality:Now let me run the pytest check for the specific tests I created (unit tests only, avoiding slow integration tests):Now let me run the mypy check:Perfect! All checks have passed. Now let me verify that the task has been completed by checking the task description again:I have successfully completed Step 1. Let me update the task tracker to mark the first step as completed. Let me also ensure I'm working on the first step items in the tracker:Perfect! Now I need to prepare the git commit message. Let me create a concise commit message for Step 1:

**Git Commit Message:** `Create CLI utility module with shared parameter parsing`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed:
- ✅ Used MCP tools exclusively for code quality checks and file operations  
- ✅ All three code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- ✅ Used MCP filesystem tools for file creation and editing
- ✅ No issues remain unresolved

**Step 1 Implementation Summary:**
- Created `src/mcp_coder/cli/utils.py` with `parse_llm_method_from_args()` function that serves as a shared utility for CLI parameter parsing
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/cli/test_utils.py` with both mocked and integration test cases
- All code quality checks passed without issues
- Function properly delegates to existing `parse_llm_method()` from the LLM session module

The implementation provides a clean wrapper that eliminates code duplication across CLI commands and maintains the existing error handling behavior.
