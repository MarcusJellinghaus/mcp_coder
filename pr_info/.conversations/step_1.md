Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the current task from the TASK_TRACKER.md. Let me first read the task tracker to understand what needs to be done.Now let me read the detailed requirements for Step 1:Perfect! Now I understand the task. Let me create a todo list and implement Step 1:Let me start with the first task - moving the mcp-code-checker dependency:Now I'll move the mcp-code-checker dependency from dev to main dependencies:Great! Now let me mark the first task as completed and move to the second task:Now let me read the existing prompts.md file to understand the format and add the Mypy Fix Prompt:Perfect! I can see the format. Now I'll add the Mypy Fix Prompt section. Based on the pattern, I'll add it after the existing prompts:Excellent! Now let me mark the second task as completed and move to the quality checks:Now let me run the quality checks to ensure everything works correctly. First, let me check the test README to understand what tests to run:Perfect! Based on the requirements, I should run the fast unit tests only to avoid slow integration tests. Let me run all three quality checks:It looks like there are pytest failures. Let me get more details about the pytest failures:I see the issue! The problem is that I added a duplicate header "Mypy Fix Prompt" in the prompts.md file. Looking at the error, it appears I have both a section header "### Mypy Fix Prompt" and a prompt header "#### Mypy Fix Prompt" which is causing the duplicate detection to fail.

Let me check the current structure and fix this:I can see the issue now! I have both "### Mypy Fix Prompt" (section header) and "#### Mypy Fix Prompt" (prompt header) which creates a duplicate. Looking at the existing pattern, I should use different names. Let me fix this by renaming the section header:Now let me run the tests again to see if the duplicate header issue is fixed:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me run the full quality checks one more time to confirm everything is working:Excellent! All quality checks are now passing. Let me update the todo list to mark the final task as completed:Now let me update the TASK_TRACKER.md to mark Step 1 as completed:Perfect! I have successfully completed Step 1. Let me provide you with a summary:
