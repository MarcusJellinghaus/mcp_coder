# Implementation Task: Update unit tests in `test_claude_code_api.py` for lazy verification behavior

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Update unit tests in `test_claude_code_api.py` for lazy verification behavior

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

## ✅ Task Completed: Update Unit Tests for Lazy Verification

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Added `CLINotFoundError` import from `claude_code_sdk._errors`
2. ✅ Updated `test_create_claude_client_basic` - expects no preemptive verification
3. ✅ Renamed and updated `test_create_claude_client_verification_fails` → `test_create_claude_client_sdk_failure_triggers_verification` - expects verification only after SDK failure
4. ✅ Updated `test_create_claude_client_with_env` - expects no preemptive verification with env vars
5. ✅ Removed unused `platform` import

**Code Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Pylint: No issues
- ✅ Pytest: Tests fail as expected (TDD - correct behavior before implementation)
- ✅ Mypy: No type errors

**Commit Message Prepared:**
```
test: update unit tests for lazy Claude CLI verification

Update TestCreateClaudeClient tests to expect lazy verification behavior:
- Tests now expect no preemptive verification in success path
- SDK failure triggers verification for better error diagnostics
- Removed unused platform import
- Added CLINotFoundError import for SDK exception handling

Tests fail as expected (TDD) - implementation in Step 2 will make them pass.
```

**Task Status:** Marked as complete in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`

All CLAUDE.md requirements followed - used MCP tools exclusively for all operations.
