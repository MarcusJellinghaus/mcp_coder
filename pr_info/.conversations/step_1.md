Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement WORKFLOW_LABELS constant in workflows/define_labels.py with all 10 status labels

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completed ✓

**Task:** Implement WORKFLOW_LABELS constant in workflows/define_labels.py with all 10 status labels

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `workflows/define_labels.py`** with:
   - WORKFLOW_LABELS constant containing all 10 status labels
   - Each label as a tuple: (name, color, description)
   - Colors in 6-character hex format without '#' prefix (GitHub API format)
   - All 10 workflow status labels from the specification:
     - status-01:created through status-10:pr-created
   
2. **Added color validation at module load**:
   - `_validate_color_format()` function to validate 6-character hex codes
   - `_validate_workflow_labels()` function to validate entire WORKFLOW_LABELS structure
   - Module-level validation call to catch errors immediately on import
   - Validates: tuple structure, label names, color formats, descriptions

3. **Code quality checks passed**:
   - ✅ Pylint: No issues
   - ✅ Mypy: No issues in define_labels.py (pre-existing issue in implement.py unrelated)

### Commit message:
```
Implement WORKFLOW_LABELS constant with validation
```

The implementation is complete and ready for the next task (creating tests).
