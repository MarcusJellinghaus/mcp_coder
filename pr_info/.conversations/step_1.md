Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I'll help you implement the task of adding the `github_integration` test marker to `pyproject.toml`. Let me start by reading the task tracker and understanding the current state.Now let me read the current `pyproject.toml` to understand the existing test markers:Now I need to add the `github_integration` test marker to the markers list in the `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section. Let me read the tests README to understand how this marker should be documented:Now I'll add the `github_integration` test marker to the `pyproject.toml` file. Based on the existing pattern, I need to add it to the markers list with a description following the same format:Perfect! Now let me run the code quality checks to verify the implementation:Let me run pytest with the fast unit tests only as recommended in the instructions:Excellent! All code quality checks are passing. Let me update the task status in the TASK_TRACKER.md:Now let me mark the other sub-tasks for Step 1 as completed since they were all accomplished:## Task Completion Summary
