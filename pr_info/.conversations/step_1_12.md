# Implementation Task: Write test: `test_get_eligible_issues_filters_by_bot_pickup_labels()`

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Write test: `test_get_eligible_issues_filters_by_bot_pickup_labels()`

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
Excellent! Let me now provide a summary of what I've completed:

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task: **Write test: `test_get_eligible_issues_filters_by_bot_pickup_labels()`**

### What was accomplished:

1. **Created comprehensive TDD test** in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:699-805`:
   - Added a new test class `TestGetEligibleIssues`
   - Wrote `test_get_eligible_issues_filters_by_bot_pickup_labels()` test method
   - Test validates filtering logic for issues with exactly ONE bot_pickup label
   - Test includes mock data for various scenarios:
     - Issues with valid bot_pickup labels (should be included)
     - Issues without bot_pickup labels (should be excluded)
     - Issues with multiple bot_pickup labels (should be excluded)
   - Test verifies priority ordering (status-08 → status-02)

2. **Added necessary import** to `src/mcp_coder/cli/commands/coordinator.py:15`:
   - Imported `IssueManager` from `...utils.github_operations.issue_manager`
   - This allows the test mocks to work correctly

3. **Updated test imports** in `tests/cli/commands/test_coordinator.py:18`:
   - Added import for `IssueData` TypedDict

4. **Verified code quality**:
   - ✅ Pylint check passed (no issues)
   - ✅ Pytest check passed (all 27 existing tests pass)
   - ✅ Mypy check passed for source code (test file has expected error since function doesn't exist yet)

5. **Updated TASK_TRACKER.md**:
   - Marked task as complete: `[x] Write test: test_get_eligible_issues_filters_by_bot_pickup_labels()`

### Notes:

The test is correctly written in TDD style - it will fail until the `get_eligible_issues()` function is implemented in a later task. This is expected and correct behavior. The test validates:
- Filtering by bot_pickup labels (exactly one required)
- Exclusion of issues without bot_pickup labels
- Exclusion of issues with multiple bot_pickup labels
- Priority ordering (status-08:ready-pr has highest priority)
- Proper API calls to IssueManager

All CLAUDE.md requirements have been followed:
- Used MCP code-checker tools for all quality checks
- All existing tests pass
- Code quality checks passed (except expected TDD failure)
- Task marked complete in TASK_TRACKER.md
