# Implementation Task: Add Command Routing

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
You are implementing tasks from a task tracker. Follow these steps in order:

**STEP 1: SELECT TASK**
- Read `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Find the FIRST unchecked task (format: `- [ ] Task description`)
- Announce which task you're working on

**STEP 2: IMPLEMENT**
- Read the linked step file in `pr_info/steps/` for detailed requirements
- Implement ONLY what's described - no extra complexity
- If you encounter issues or need decisions, ask immediately

**STEP 3: VERIFY WITH CODE QUALITY CHECKS**
- Run MCP code checker tools (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- See `tests/readme.md` for test execution guidelines (avoid slow integration tests when possible)
- Fix ALL issues found by the checkers
- Repeat checks until everything passes

**STEP 4: VERIFY TASK COMPLETION**
- Re-read the task requirements in `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- Confirm ALL requirements are met
- Verify all code quality checks pass

**STEP 5: PREPARE COMMIT MESSAGE** ⚠️ REQUIRED
- Generate a short, concise commit message with step name in the title
- DO NOT actually perform the commit - only prepare the message
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and mark the commit message preparation task as complete
- Change its checkbox from `- [ ] Prepare git commit message` to `- [x] Prepare git commit message`

**STEP 6: MARK MAIN TASK COMPLETE** ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
- Edit `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` using the appropriate file editing tool
- Change the main implementation task checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Example: `- [ ] Implement core.py` becomes `- [x] Implement core.py`
- Verify the file was actually updated
- ⚠️ WARNING: If you skip this step, the workflow will loop infinitely on the same task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work on EXACTLY ONE task per run - do not pick additional tasks
- You MUST complete Step 5 (mark task as `[x]`) before finishing
- The checkbox update is non-negotiable and required for workflow progression

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Add Command Routing

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
## Task Completion Summary

**Task: Add Command Routing (Step 3)**

✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### Implementation Details

The command routing for the `create-pr` command was already fully implemented in `src/mcp_coder/cli/main.py`. All three required integration points are in place:

1. **Import Statement** (line 8):
   ```python
   from .commands.create_pr import execute_create_pr
   ```

2. **Subcommand Parser** (lines 199-212):
   ```python
   create_pr_parser = subparsers.add_parser(
       "create-pr", help="Create pull request with AI-generated summary"
   )
   create_pr_parser.add_argument("--project-dir", ...)
   create_pr_parser.add_argument("--llm-method", ...)
   ```

3. **Command Routing** (lines 261-262):
   ```python
   elif args.command == "create-pr":
       return execute_create_pr(args)
   ```

### Validation Results

✅ **All Code Quality Checks Pass:**
- **Pytest**: 87 tests passed, 15 skipped (all CLI tests)
- **Pylint**: No issues found
- **Mypy**: No type errors found

✅ **TASK_TRACKER.md Updated:**
- "Add Command Routing" task marked as complete `[x]`
- All validation subtasks marked as complete `[x]`
- "Prepare git commit message" marked as complete `[x]`

### Prepared Commit Message

```
feat(cli): complete create-pr command integration (Step 3)

All integration points for create-pr command are already in place:
- Import statement for execute_create_pr added
- Subcommand parser with --project-dir and --llm-method arguments configured
- Command routing in main() function implemented

The command is now fully accessible via: mcp-coder create-pr

Validation:
- All CLI tests pass (87 passed, 15 skipped)
- Pylint check passes with no issues
- Mypy type checking passes with no errors
```

### ✅ All CLAUDE.md Requirements Followed
- Used MCP code-checker tools exclusively for quality checks
- All three code quality checks passed (pylint, pytest, mypy)
- No issues remain unresolved
- Task properly marked as complete in TASK_TRACKER.md

The `create-pr` command is now fully integrated and ready for use!
