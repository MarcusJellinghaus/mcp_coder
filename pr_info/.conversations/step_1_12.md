# Implementation Task: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

## Prompt Sent to LLM:
Please look at `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` and pick the next task that should be done.
Please let me know on which task you are working on.
Please implement!
Please verify your implementation running the various checks of the MCP server and by solving potential issues (and repeat).
Please do not invent extra complexity not mentioned in the project plan.
Please let me know in case you encounter any issues or need a decision.
Please provide a short concise commit message stating the step name in the title. Do NOT perform a commit!

Once you are done, please check again that task description on `pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md` to ensure that everything is done.
Once everything is done, please mark the task as done.
Please work only on one task. Do not pick further tasks.

Please also take a look at the tests\readme.md and only run those tests that are required in your context -i.e. avoid slow integration tests.

Current task from TASK_TRACKER.md: Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions

Please implement this task step by step.

## LLM Response:
I need to clarify the situation with the user since the task they mentioned doesn't match what I see in the TASK_TRACKER.md:

Looking at **pr_info/TASK_TRACKER.md**, I can see that:

1. **All implementation steps (1-8) are marked as complete [x]** - the code has been implemented
2. **Some steps are missing the "Prepare git commit message" subtask:**
   - Step 4: Missing commit message ❌
   - Step 5: Missing commit message ❌  
   - Step 6: Missing commit message ❌
   - Step 8: Missing commit message ❌

3. **The git status shows a clean working tree** - all changes are already committed

**The task you mentioned "Implement core.py with utilities and type definitions" doesn't appear in the tracker.**

Could you please clarify:
- Are you referring to a different task tracker file?
- Should I work on the next incomplete task from TASK_TRACKER.md (which would be "Prepare git commit message for Step 4")?
- Or is there a new task to implement core.py that's not yet documented in the tracker?
