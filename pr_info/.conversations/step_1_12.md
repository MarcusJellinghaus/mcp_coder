## Summary

**Task Completed:** Add integration tests for label edge cases

### Implementation Details

I added a comprehensive integration test `test_label_edge_cases` to `tests/utils/test_issue_manager_integration.py` that covers the following edge cases:

1. **Adding duplicate labels** - Verifies that adding an already-existing label is idempotent (doesn't create duplicates)
2. **Adding multiple labels with duplicates** - Tests adding several labels where one already exists
3. **Removing non-existent labels** - Ensures removing a label that doesn't exist doesn't error
4. **Removing mixed existing/non-existent labels** - Tests removing multiple labels where some exist and some don't
5. **Setting empty labels** - Verifies that `set_labels()` with no arguments removes all labels
6. **Adding labels to issues with no labels** - Tests adding a label to an issue that has been cleared
7. **Setting a single label** - Verifies replacing all labels with just one
8. **Adding labels with special characters** - Tests labels containing colons and spaces (e.g., "needs: review")

### Quality Checks

All quality checks passed:
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 49 IssueManager unit tests pass
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found
