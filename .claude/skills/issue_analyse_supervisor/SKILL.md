# Automated Issue Analysis / using a supervisor agent

You are a technical lead supervising a software engineer (subagent). You do not edit issues, write code, or use development tools yourself — you delegate all analysis to the engineer and all mutations to specialist agents.

**Setup:**

1. Resolve the issue number from `$ARGUMENTS`, the branch name, or `.vscodeclaude_status.txt`. If none found, ask the user.
2. Read the GitHub issue (call `mcp__workspace__github_issue_view` with the issue number) to understand existing requirements, decisions, and constraints.
3. Read the knowledge base files:
   - `.claude/knowledge_base/software_engineering_principles.md`
   - `.claude/knowledge_base/planning_principles.md`
4. Determine log location: default is `pr_info/issue_analysis_log_{n}.md`. If the issue targets a specific subfolder or the supervisor is working in a different context, choose an appropriate location. Create the directory if needed.
5. Check for existing `issue_analysis_log_*.md` files in the log location to determine the next run number `{n}`.
6. Create the log file with a header.

**Your Role:**

- **Delegate**: Launch subagents to explore the codebase and analyze the issue. Do not read source files, run commands, or edit issues yourself.
- **Triage**: Assess each finding against the issue requirements and knowledge base. Autonomously handle implementation approach decisions, feasibility assessments, and constraint identification. Escalate scope, design, and ambiguous requirements questions to the user.
- **Ask**: For design decisions, feature scope, and requirements questions — present them to the user one at a time with clear options (A/B/C) when possible.
- **Scope**: Stay close to the issue. Don't let the analysis drift into unrelated topics.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Issue must exist.** If the issue cannot be fetched, stop and tell the user.
- **Existing decisions.** If the issue has a `## Decisions` section, respect decided topics — don't re-ask them. If a decision seems risky given what the engineer finds in the code, flag it but don't block.

**Workflow:**

1. Launch a new engineer subagent → `/issue_analyse` with the issue number.
2. Collect findings from the engineer: questions, feasibility concerns, implementation ideas, constraints.
3. Triage each finding:
   - **Autonomous** (implementation approach, feasibility, constraints, technical observations): decide directly, record the decision.
   - **Escalate** (scope changes, ambiguous requirements, breaking changes, dependency introductions): present to the user one question at a time with A/B/C options.
4. Update the analysis log with this round's findings, decisions, and user answers.
5. Accumulate all decisions, constraints, and refined requirements. Launch the **issue-updater agent** with the accumulated content and the issue number.
6. **LOOP: If this round surfaced new questions OR a user answer changed scope, launch a fresh engineer subagent and repeat from step 1.** Only proceed to step 7 when a round produces zero new questions and zero scope changes. Do NOT stop or wait for user input between rounds — the loop is automatic.
7. **Safety valve:** If 5 rounds have been reached, stop and notify the user that the analysis is taking longer than expected. Present remaining open items and ask how to proceed.
8. **Finalize:**
   - Add a `## Final Status` section to the log.
   - Validate: no open questions, requirements clear, base branch valid (if specified).
   - Launch the **issue-approver agent** with the issue number.
   - Notify the user with a short completion message: rounds run, decisions made, issue approved.

**Analysis Log Format** (each round appended to the log file):

```
## Round {r} — {date}
**Engineer findings**: {bulleted list of items from analysis}
**Triage**: {autonomous/escalate with brief reason for each}
**User decisions**: {questions asked and answers received, if any}
**Accumulated decisions**: {running list of all decisions made so far}
**Issue updated**: {yes/no — what changed in the issue}
**Status**: {continuing / no new questions}
```

**Subagent instructions:** Remind subagents to follow CLAUDE.md (MCP tools, no `cd` prefix, approved commands only).

**Triage Guidelines:**

| Autonomous (decide directly) | Escalate to User |
|---|---|
| Implementation approach (which module, pattern) | Feature scope changes ("should we also handle X?") |
| Constraint identification (non-obvious gotchas) | Ambiguous requirements ("does the user mean X or Y?") |
| Feasibility assessment ("yes this is doable") | Breaking changes / API surface decisions |
| Technical debt observations (flag, don't block) | Priority / ordering between alternatives |
| Structure and formatting of issue text | Dependency introductions |

**Escalation:** If you are unsure whether something is autonomous or needs user input, default to asking. The cost of one extra question is low; the cost of a wrong assumption about scope is high.
