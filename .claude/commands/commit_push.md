# Commit and Push Changes

Follow this process to commit and push your changes:

## 1. Format Code
```bash
./tools/format_all.sh
```

## 2. Review Changes
```bash
git status
git diff
```

## 3. Stage Changes
Stage all relevant changes (exclude any files that shouldn't be committed).

## 4. Commit
Create a commit with a clear, conventional commit message:
- Use format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep summary under 50 characters
- **No Claude Code footer or attribution in commit message**

## 5. Push
```bash
git push
```

If the branch doesn't exist on remote yet:
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```
