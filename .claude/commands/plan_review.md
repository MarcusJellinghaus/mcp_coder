# Review Implementation Plan

**First, ensure we're up to date:**
```bash
git fetch
git status
```

Confirm and display the current feature branch name.

---

**Then review the plan:**

Please review the project plan for a new feature in folder `pr_info/steps`.
Please revise the project plan with a balanced level of detail.
Please let me know if any complexity could be reduced.
Please let me know any questions / comments or suggestions you might have.

Please consider the already discussed and decided decisions (if any) under decisions.
We do not need to challenge them again unless absolutely necessary.

**Focus on:**
- Completeness of implementation steps
- Appropriate level of detail
- Opportunities for simplification (KISS principle)
- Test coverage strategy
- Potential risks or blockers
