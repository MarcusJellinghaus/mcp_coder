# Step-by-step Discussion

Interactively walk through all open suggestions, questions, and proposed changes one by one.

Can we go through all open suggested changes and questions step by step?
You explain, ask and I answer until we discussed all topics?
Please offer, whenever possible, simple options like 
- A
- B
- C
Always just ask ONE question
